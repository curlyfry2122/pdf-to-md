Scenario leads to rapid cuts in all pollutants in all regions. By 2035, emissions of fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) in aggregate fall 
by 70% in advanced economies, driven largely by less oil use in road transport, and almost 
80% in emerging market and developing economies, driven by less use of coal in power 
generation. The benefits by 2035 include that the number of people exposed to heavily 
polluted air falls to essentially zero in advanced economies and drops fivefold in emerging 
market and developing economies compared to the current level. 
These emissions cuts deliver public health benefits. By 2035, around 2 fewer million people 
per year die prematurely from ambient air pollution compared to today; 85% of these 
avoided deaths are in emerging market and developing economies. Universal access to clean 
cooking avoids around 2.1 million deaths per year from household air pollution, a drop of 
85%. 
7.4.3 
Energy security 
The NZE Scenario presents a complex set of opportunities and challenges for energy security, 
requiring careful attention from policy makers. This section addresses various issues related 
to energy security along the path to net zero emissions. 
Fuel security 
As investment in low-emissions energy supply and energy efficiency is scaled up in the 
NZE Scenario, investments in the supply of fossil fuels and in the construction and 
maintenance of related infrastructure are scaled back. However, they do not drop to zero. 
Continued investment is required to counteract the effect of natural decline rates in oil and 
gas fields (IEA, 2025c), and some infrastructure, such as natural gas networks, import 
terminals or natural gas peaking plants, are needed for some time to provide buffers for the 
energy system. The transition will therefore require careful sequencing of the scaling up of 
low-emissions energy supply; continued operations, maintenance and possible repurposing 
of critical fuel supply infrastructure; and eventual safe decommissioning. 
As low-emissions energy meets an ever-growing share of demand in the NZE Scenario, the 
production of oil and natural gas becomes concentrated in low-cost suppliers. In the 
NZE Scenario, the share of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries + (OPEC+) in 
oil supply increases to around 55% by 2035. Governments will need to decide whether to 
seek to preserve domestic production and/or stockholding capacity for oil and gas to provide 
a counterweight to this increasing geographical concentration.  
In the NZE Scenario, prices in international fuel markets fall in line with declining demand. 
This has beneficial effects for fuel importers, which see fuel import bills cut by more than 
two-thirds by 2035. However, lower revenues for producer economies in the NZE Scenario 
imply significant macroeconomic and fiscal challenges, given the reliance of these economies 
on revenues from the sale of fuels in international markets, and a consequent need for 
proactive economic diversification policies.

Electricity security 
The NZE Scenario implies sharper challenges for electricity security. As electricity comes to 
provide over half of the energy consumed around the world by 2050 in the NZE Scenario, the 
economic consequences of potential disruptions increase. The electricity sector becomes 
more complex in the NZE Scenario, with growing supply from variable sources of generation 
and increasing consumption from a wide range of end-uses such as EVs and heat pumps. 
Maintaining electricity security will require a diverse portfolio of measures.  
Dispatchable capacity will be critical to balance the power systems and particularly to meet 
seasonal flexibility needs. In the NZE Scenario, total installed dispatchable capacity, excluding 
batteries, is maintained broadly at current levels through to 2035, even as variable sources 
of generation take an increasing share of generation. Dispatchable renewables such as 
hydropower, geothermal and bioenergy play a role here, as does nuclear power. As their 
costs fall sharply, batteries come to play an increasingly important role to absorb surplus 
renewables and meet peak demand. The installed capacity of batteries reaches around 
2 900 GW by 2035, an 11-fold increase from the current level; this is in line with the scaling 
up of the installed capacity of solar PV over the past decade. While batteries are well-suited 
today to provide short-term flexibility needs for durations of several hours, other forms of 
longer duration storage, such as pumped hydro, are also needed.  
Demand-response measures offer significant but still underutilised potential to make 
electricity systems more flexible and secure. Tapping this potential will require incentives 
and market structures that value demand response, infrastructure such as smart controls, 
and the innovative use of technology to manage controllable loads efficiently and securely. 
Overbuilding of renewables projects and curtailment of surplus generation can contribute to 
cost-effective strategies to ensure electricity security in systems with high penetration of 
renewables. Electricity grids see high levels of investment in the NZE Scenario, reflecting the 
need for expansion and modernisation to ensure the timely connection of generation and 
load projects, and the need to ensure that the grid can play a crucial role in electricity 
security.   
Critical minerals security 
Demand for critical minerals rises much faster in the NZE Scenario than in other scenarios. 
For example, demand for copper – fundamental to all electrical applications – is around 25% 
higher in 2035 than in the STEPS. Lithium demand is 70% higher. Nickel, cobalt and graphite 
demand is 30-50% higher. While concerns around supply concentration remain crucial, 
additional volume challenges emerge in the NZE Scenario (Figure 7.28). 
In the STEPS, recent project announcements have narrowed expected supply gaps for many 
minerals, however, copper is a notable exception. In the NZE Scenario, most minerals still 
require additional projects, further innovation and expanded recycling to bridge the gap 
between supply and demand. For example, expected copper supply from existing and 
announced projects in 2035 falls short of projected demand by over 40%, compared with

around 30% in the STEPS. For nickel and cobalt, announced projects are broadly sufficient to 
meet demand growth in the STEPS, but shortfalls remain in the NZE Scenario.

 Additional supply, further innovation and expanded recycling are required 
to bridge the gap between critical mineral supply and demand in the NZE Scenario 
Note: Mt = million tonne; Mt Li = million tonnes of lithium metal content; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 
Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. 
Unreliable supply of critical minerals could significantly affect both the pace of progress and 
the cost of achieving the goals in the NZE Scenario. Some minerals account for a large share 
of total energy technology costs, so price spikes would inevitably have implications for 
manufacturing costs and ultimately for consumer prices (see Chapter 5). Supply disruptions 
could also derail efforts to diversify energy technology manufacturing, concentrating supply 
chains further and affecting industrial development and jobs. Action is needed both in the 
near term to strengthen preparedness for potential disruptions, and in the medium term to 
diversify supply chains and mitigate structural risks. Securing reliable critical mineral supplies 
is essential not only for energy security but also to ensure an orderly, affordable energy 
transition consistent with the 1.5 °C goal.  
7.4.4 
Implications for the next ten years 
By 2035, the NZE Scenario sees global energy-related emissions fall by around 50% from 2024 
levels, and electricity use rise to account for one-third of total final consumption. The 
installed capacity of renewables reaches around 19 600 GW, increasing fourfold from 2024. 
Other low-emissions sources such as nuclear also see rapid growth, enabling deep cuts to be 
made in electricity sector emissions. The average annual increase in energy efficiency is

maintained at around 4% per year through to 2035, compared with 2% in 2022. Deep cuts in 
energy sector methane emissions help to lower peak warming, avoiding an even higher 
overshoot of the 1.5 °C goal. By 2035, energy sector methane emissions are 80% lower than 
today.  
Deployment of options that have a critical role to cut emissions in the longer term start to 
accelerate by 2035 in the NZE Scenario. Total CO₂ capture increases to around 2 260 Mt, a 
more than 50-fold increase over today’s levels (Table 7.1). Of this, around 660 Mt is removed 
from the atmosphere, up from near zero today. Removals are indispensable not only to reach 
net zero emissions by 2050 but also to achieve net negative emissions in the second-half of 
the century and thus bringing warming back below 1.5 °C by 2100. Hydrogen and hydrogen-
based fuels, new nuclear reactor designs, advanced geothermal, novel storage technologies 
and other innovative technologies also start to be widely deployed. Low-emissions hydrogen 
production, for example, rises from less than 1 Mt today to around 125 Mt by 2035.

Chapter 8 
Regional insights 
Diverse priorities, diverse pathways 
• This chapter explores energy sector trends and priorities in countries and regions that 
cumulatively account for around 90% of the world’s population, GDP and energy 
demand. Priorities, objectives and national circumstances vary widely between and 
within regions, but two trends that are visible in most parts of the world are a rise in 
the electrification of end-uses, and a rise in the share of renewables in electricity 
generation. 
• Energy trends in advanced economies are shaped by the structure of their economies, 
and by high average incomes and rates of vehicle and appliance ownership. Overall 
energy demand typically has peaked, although electricity use continues to increase, 
with electric vehicles and data centres adding to demand.  
• Energy demand per capita is generally lower in emerging market and developing 
economies. Many of these countries are still developing their industries, some suffer 
from a lack of universal access to energy, and most have lower average incomes and 
levels of ownership of energy consuming equipment than advanced economies. 
However, the picture is a dynamic one: many countries are undergoing rapid 
urbanisation, building infrastructure, making swift progress on access to modern 
energy, and seeing their economies and their demand for energy grow strongly.  
• Energy security is a key determinant of energy policies. While energy security is a 
broad term that includes affordability and supply chain resilience, an often cited 
metric is import dependence on fuels, notably oil, natural gas and coal. Several large 
economies are net importers of energy. These include Japan, Korea, European Union, 
India and China. Others, notably the Middle East, Eurasia, Africa and the United 
States, are net exporters of energy. A high level of import dependence can act as a 
spur to boost renewable and nuclear energy, diversify sources of supply and improve 
energy efficiency.  
• This chapter explores energy pathways in different countries and regions. It also 
includes a deep dive into a pertinent topic for each region. For the United States, Latin 
America and Africa, we explore themes that focus on the development of domestic 
resources. For India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, we explore the strategies 
and policies being deployed to manage energy demand growth in ways that are 
aligned with country and regional priorities. For the European Union, Japan and 
Korea, we explore themes of competitiveness and energy security. We also explore 
the future of coal demand in China, and prospects for natural gas exports from Russia.

Introduction 
This chapter explores energy sector pathways for countries and regions that together 
account for nearly 90% of the world’s population, gross domestic product (GDP) and energy 
demand. Key economic, demographic and energy sector metrics vary widely between these 
regions, reflecting their diverse histories and shaping their future policy priorities. Our 
analysis traces how regional trends have evolved over time by examining the changes that 
have taken place across a range of indicators.  
China, followed by India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East have been the main engines of 
growth over the past decade – accounting for over 90% of the increase in global energy 
demand and nearly 60% of global GDP growth (Figure 8.1). The rise in their energy demand 
has been driven by increasing industrialisation and urbanisation, plus expanding ownership 
of appliances and vehicles. There has been a gradual move toward less energy-intensive 
economic activities in some other regions, along with a focus on improving efficiency. These 
trends are particularly pronounced in advanced economies, where energy needs have begun 
to plateau or even decline. For example, energy demand in the European Union in 2024 was 
about 10% lower than in 2015, even though its economy grew by nearly 20% in this period. 
There are also lingering impacts from the Covid-19 pandemic, as some sectors – notably 
industry – did not rebound in some regions.

The energy landscape looks markedly different when considering per capita energy demand 
(Figure 8.2). Countries and regions including the United States, parts of Eurasia, advanced 
Asian economies, and the Middle East have relatively high per capita energy demand as a 
result of a combination of factors including higher incomes, significant heating or cooling 
needs, the presence of a large industrial base, and in some cases fossil fuel subsidies. At the 
other end of the spectrum, per capita demand in Africa remains very low, not least because 
almost one billion people still lack access to clean cooking and almost 600 million people lack 
access to electricity, mainly in rural sub-Saharan Africa. 
Figure 8.2 ⊳ 
Energy demand per capita and population by region/country, 
2024 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
There are wide variations in per capita energy demand across countries and regions 
Note: GJ = gigajoule; LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean. Energy demand per capita corresponds to the 
ratio of total energy demand to population. 
Another metric that reveals significant variations across regions is the share of electricity 
generation accounted for by low-emissions sources, which accounted for 41% of global 
electricity generation in 2024, of which 32% is from renewables and 9% from nuclear. The 
European Union (EU) sources over 70% of its electricity from low-emissions sources, of which 
48% is renewables and 23% is nuclear. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) report an even 
higher renewable share at 63%, which is mostly hydropower, but nuclear has a much smaller 
share. At the other end of the scale, today low-emissions sources have a very small share in 
power generation in the Middle East, where natural gas and oil dominate the generation mix. 
The share of electricity in total final consumption is another important metric (Figure 8.3). 
Japan and Korea long led in this regard, and are now joined by China as the most electrified 
regions, reflecting the rapid uptake of electricity use in industry, increasing appliance 
ownership, expanding demand for space cooling and growing electromobility. Similar rapid

growth has also been observed in Southeast Asia and India, while shares of electricity are 
lowest in Africa and Eurasia, where such trends are only beginning to emerge and advancing 
more gradually.  
Figure 8.3 ⊳

electricity generation by region, 2000-2024  
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Renewables and nuclear electricity have evolved unevenly across regions since 2000, 
end-use electrification also varied, growing particularly rapidly in Asian economies 
Stark differences in fossil fuel import dependence – often cited as an indicator of energy 
security – are apparent across the various regions. Today, well over 80% of oil demand in 
Japan, Korea, European Union and India is met by imports, and the same goes for over 40% 
of natural gas demand in these regions and China (Figure 8.4). A high level of dependence on 
imported fossil fuels can spur efforts to boost renewables and nuclear energy, diversify 
sources of supply and improve energy efficiency. 
New national climate commitments known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) 
are due in 2025 from the signatories of the Paris Agreement. As of 5 November 2025, 
74 parties representing about 55% of global energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
had submitted new NDCs to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) secretariat (Table 8.1). A further 50 countries are due to communicate their NDC 
before or at the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP) COP30 in Belém, Brazil. The full 
impact of new NDCs will be reflected in future analysis.  
The rest of this chapter takes a closer look at different regions. It explores their outlooks for 
energy supply and demand, and includes a deep dive for each on a pertinent topic.

United States 
8.2.1 Key energy trends 
The US energy policy landscape is undergoing significant change. The passage of the One Big 
Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in 2025 signals a renewed emphasis on domestic energy 
production – notably coal, nuclear, geothermal, oil and natural gas – and energy 
infrastructure development. The OBBBA mandates oil and gas lease sales on federal lands 
and offshore areas; reinstates tax deductions for drilling; and maintains, extends or enhances 
tax credits for carbon capture technologies, nuclear power, geothermal energy, bioenergy 
and battery storage. It also accelerates the phase-out of tax credits for wind, solar 
photovoltaics (PV) and electric vehicles (EVs). These policy changes, along with a series of 
regulatory, federal staffing, and public funding and financing changes, are re-shaping the US 
energy landscape. 
Figure 8.5 ⊳ 
Total energy demand by source in the United States in the CPS, 
2000-2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Natural gas demand continues to increase into the 2030s and then declines slightly,  
coal demand gradually falls, nuclear capacity increases significantly 
Note: EJ = exajoule. 
In the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), total energy demand in the United States is projected 
to rise by 0.5% per year to 2035, marking a return to growth after broadly stable demand 
over the past two decades. Natural gas sees significant growth in demand to 2035 and 
remains the largest US energy source through to 2050 (Figure 8.5). Oil demand continues to 
slowly increase in the medium and plateaus in the long term, while coal steadily declines to 
2050. Nuclear power remains stable in the near term before a new wave of large reactors 
and small modular reactors being developed today come online in the 2030s, backed by

supportive policies and strong interest from technology firms. This nuclear comeback 
depends on continuing efforts to develop the workforce and supply chains for construction 
and fuels. Bioenergy remains the largest renewable energy source through to 2050, while 
solar PV and wind power continue to expand, albeit more slowly than in recent years. 
The power sector and the various end-use sectors in the United States each have a distinct 
energy mix, but they all see rising energy demand in the CPS (Figure 8.6). In transport, oil 
remains dominant, accounting for over 80% of total transport energy use each year to 2050. 
In the buildings sector, electricity continues to play a central role, meeting nearly all new 
demand and gradually displacing oil use, while natural gas consumption remains broadly 
stable. However, natural gas does meet the largest share of new demand for data centres 
(Box 8.1). Industry maintains a diverse fuel mix, with natural gas meeting half of new 
demand, while oil and electricity use also increase. In the power sector, natural gas demand 
continues to rise to 2035, and it remains the largest source of electricity generation through 
to 2050. Demand also increases for a broad array of renewable energy technologies, 
including next-generation geothermal, bioenergy, hydropower, solar PV and wind.

Oil demand in transport stays broadly flat, while natural gas demand rises in the power 
sector to 2035, and electricity use in buildings – including data centres – grows 
Note: EJ = exajoule; TWh = terawatt-hour. 
The long-term outlook is inevitably uncertain: it will alter as the policy framework evolves, 
and as energy stakeholders adapt to that evolution. In the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), 
the US trajectory reflects stronger influence from state-level actions that include, among 
other things, renewable portfolio standards in the power sector. In this scenario, total energy 
demand stays broadly stable through to 2035, with limited natural gas growth, a modest

decline in oil and a significant reduction in coal use, a continued positive outlook for nuclear, 
and increasing adoption of renewables, driven in part by the assumed extension of state 
mandates in the STEPS. 
Box 8.1 ⊳ 
Update on electricity supply to power US data centres 
The IEA published its first report on Energy and AI in April 2025 (IEA, 2025a). It includes 
detailed analysis of electricity demand for data centres and examines how electricity 
supply might meet that demand. Policy changes at the federal level since then have 
changed the outlook for the US electricity sector, and with it the outlook for electricity 
supply to power data centres. Taking this into account, we have updated our analysis to 
reflect the changed policy landscape, and in particular to take account of current plans 
to phase out tax credits for a number of renewable energy technologies, including solar 
PV and wind power. Yet, there are three key factors that remain largely unchanged: 
corporate renewable and other low-emissions energy and net zero emission targets, 
which many technology companies – including the big four – continue to pursue; state-
level renewable portfolio standards; and bottlenecks in the gas turbine supply chain.  
Natural gas was the biggest source for electricity to serve data centres in the United 
States in 2024, accounting for over 40% of supply. Renewables, predominantly solar PV 
and wind, contributed one-quarter of supply, while nuclear provided around 20% and 
coal close to 15%. Since nearly all data centres are connected to the grid, these shares 
essentially mirror the electricity mix of the states where the US data centres are 
concentrated.

In the CPS, electricity generation to supply data centres more than triples from around 
200 terawatt-hours (TWh) today to 640 TWh by 2035 (Figure 8.7). Natural gas-fired 
generation increases the most of any source to meet new data centre demand, rising 
260 TWh to 2035, much of it before 2030. This increase reflects continued growth for 
natural gas and is largely achieved by operating existing, grid-connected gas-fired power 
plants more often. Some developers also plan to co-locate large-scale data centres with 
new, dedicated natural gas-fired power generators, although constraints in the gas 
turbine supply chain may delay some of these projects until after 2030.  
The second-largest source of additional supply is from wind and solar PV that together 
increase by approximately 70 TWh by 2035. This is largely due to the growth of wind and 
solar capacity in states where data centres are located. To meet corporate clean energy 
targets, some data centre operators are also investing in renewables and signing power 
purchase agreements for hourly matched renewable electricity. The electricity supplied 
from other renewable energy sources that can provide baseload electricity also increases 
by around 13 TWh by 2035. Geothermal, backed by prominent hyper-scalers as a 
dispatchable source of low-emissions electricity, plays a bigger role, as does hydropower 
where the focus is on upgrading existing facilities. 
Nuclear is the third-largest source of additional electricity supply, particularly after 2030, 
when several hyper-scalers are expected to commission small modular reactors to 
provide power direct to new data centres. As a result, nuclear generation for data centres 
rises by about 70 TWh by 2035. US technology companies already have plans to finance 
more than 25 gigawatts of small modular reactors, although most of this capacity is not 
expected to materialise until after 2035. 
By 2035, natural gas is anticipated to provide over half of the electricity required by data 
centres in the United States, followed by renewables and nuclear, around 20% each, and 
coal at 7%. 
These projections differ from those in the base case in the April 2025 Energy and AI report 
on the level of demand: they add nearly 70 TWh of additional annual electricity 
generation dedicated to data centres by 2035. They also differ on how demand will be 
met: the supply mix in our revised analysis shows a significant upward revision for natural 
gas and a downward revision for wind and solar PV, reflecting the changed policy 
environment with passage of the OBBBA. 
8.2.2 What is next for the US energy powerhouse? 
The scale of the US economy is reflected in its consumption of energy, with the country 
ranking first in global terms for both oil and natural gas demand. In 2024, US oil demand 
accounted for close to 20% of the global total, while natural gas consumption exceeded 
940 billion cubic metres (bcm), about 80% more than any other country. The United States 
ranks third in coal demand. For renewables, the United States ranks second, with major

contributions to supply from bioenergy, wind, solar, hydropower and geothermal. The 
United States is the second-largest generator of electricity in the world: it produces half as 
much as China but more than twice as much as India, which ranks third. The United States 
also operates the world’s largest nuclear fleet, with over 100 gigawatts (GW) in operation 
today.

higher than the second-ranked country (Figure 8.8). These levels of production have turned 
the United States into a net exporter of oil and gas, a huge turnaround from past trends, 
allowing the country to play an increasingly influential role in global energy markets and 
energy security.  
Looking ahead, the United States is set to maintain its position as a global leader in oil and 
gas production, while expanding the use of other priority technologies such as nuclear. 
Against the background of the support for domestic oil and gas production provided by the 
OBBBA and other new federal policies, oil output rises by around 0.1 mb/d per year to 2035 
in the CPS, outpacing domestic demand and increasing net exports by 0.5 mb/d. Natural gas 
production also expands steadily, exceeding demand growth, boosting net exports by over 
130 bcm and cementing the position of the United States as the largest gas exporter globally. 
Coal production continues to decline from its 2022 peak, although enough is still produced 
to meet all domestic demand. The United States remains the largest global producer and 
consumer of oil and natural gas through to 2035 in both the CPS and the STEPS. 
The OBBBA also spurs the expansion of a number of domestic energy technologies. Nuclear 
power is poised for renewed growth, supported by continued tax credits, increased financing 
and the removal or reduction of regulatory barriers. In the CPS, nuclear capacity remains 
stable to 2030 before increasing by one-third to 2040 and more than 80% by 2050. Despite 
this growth, China catches up the United States in nuclear capacity around 2030 and takes 
the lead through to 2050. Renewable energy capacity grows by two-thirds to 2035, with 
geothermal energy increasing by 75% in the CPS from a small base, supported by tax 
incentives and accelerated permitting, for its use in both electricity generation and direct 
heat applications. Biofuels remain part of the energy mix, with continued federal support 
focused on domestic resources, and more limited incentives for sustainable aviation fuel. The 
use of biofuels increases by 6% to 2035 in the CPS. 
There is increasing recognition in the United States that resilient critical mineral supply chains 
are vital for energy technologies, industrial competitiveness and national security. The 
country is ramping up efforts to build diversified supply chains through public financing, 
industrial policy measures and strategic partnerships. The US Department of Energy and the 
Department of Defense have extended major financial support to domestic projects, 
including lithium and rare earth processing facilities, through the Defense Production Act and 
loan programmes. In early 2025, the US Export-Import Bank launched a new financing tool, 
the Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative, to provide targeted financing for critical mineral 
projects, and an Executive Order directed the Department of Defense and the US 
International Development Finance Corporation to establish a dedicated investment fund. 
Public-private partnerships are also scaling up, exemplified by a transformational deal 
between MP Materials, a leading rare earth producer in the United States, and the 
Department of Defense that involves large-scale financing support, long-term offtake and 
price floor commitments. These moves underscore the US ambition to play a leading role in 
shaping the future global critical minerals landscape.

Latin America and the Caribbean 
8.3.1 Key energy trends  
The Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region has significant untapped energy resource 
potential ranging from solar and wind to oil, biofuels and critical minerals. Climate resilience 
is a pressing issue as the region faces ever more extreme weather events and the power 
outages and other disruptions that accompany them. In November 2025, Brazil hosts COP30 
with the aim of accelerating efforts to implement climate pledges. 
Around 65% of electricity in LAC is from renewables – more than in any other region – and 
the share of renewables in electricity generation is poised to expand further. In Brazil, the 
share has already reached nearly 90% thanks in large part to hydropower, while the 
proportion of electricity generated from wind and solar power in Chile and Uruguay is among 
the highest in the world. In 2010, around 40% of its capacity additions were renewables; in 
2024 this share reached 90%, well above the global average of around 80%. The trend 
continues in the STEPS, with solar accounting for over 45% of new capacity from 2025 to 
2035 (Figure 8.9). As a result, the share of renewables in power generation is around 70% by 
2035, while the share of renewables in total energy supply rises from 30% to over 35%. Rapid 
growth in solar and wind is changing the power sector dynamics, with both Chile and Brazil 
having to curtail these sources at times in 2024 to balance the power grids. Further 
investment in high functioning grids is needed to support its evolving power mix.

Government incentives and competitively priced electric vehicles from China are boosting 
EV sales particularly in Brazil, Costa Rica, Uruguay and Colombia. Sales more than doubled in 
Brazil in 2024, with EVs from China accounting for 85% of the total. Chile and Colombia have 
some of the largest electric bus fleets globally, and close to 8% of buses sold in Mexico in 
2024 were electric. In the STEPS, existing policies and industry projects mean that nearly 25% 
of vehicles sold in the region are electric by 2035. Despite this, oil remains the largest source 
of energy used in LAC in the STEPS, largely due to the transport sector. 
The LAC region includes countries that are significant oil and gas exporters. The value of fossil 
fuel production remains broadly constant in the STEPS, with contrasting underlying trends. 
Oil production increases in Brazil, Guyana and Argentina, while it falls in Mexico, Venezuela 
and Ecuador. Argentina is the only country to see significant growth in natural gas production 
by 2035. Coal production decreases by around 65% by 2035, mostly due to lower output in 
Colombia. 
The LAC region includes countries that are important producers and exporters of critical 
minerals, accounting for around one-third of the global market in 2024. Chile is the world's 
largest producer of copper and Peru is the third-largest. The region also includes the lithium 
triangle of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. Argentina doubled its lithium production from 2022 
to 2024. LAC is rich in other critical minerals too, including rare earths and nickel. Revenue 
from production of critical minerals rises in the STEPS (Figure 8.10). Expanding the capacity 
to process and refine extracted ores could boost local economies and help diversify global 
supply chains.

8.3.2 Prospects for bioenergy in Latin America and the Caribbean 
The LAC region is a leader in bioenergy, which provided around one-fifth of its energy 
demand in 2024. Nearly 85% was from modern bioenergy. Solid modern bioenergy is its 
leading source of bioenergy, and is mostly used for light industry manufacturing activities 
such as food production. Robust bioenergy sustainability standards have an important part 
to play to limit the extent and impact of land-use change and to minimise methane 
emissions. Not all the bioenergy used in the region is modern. Despite progress in some 
countries, there are still nearly 70 million people in the region that rely on the traditional use 
of biomass for cooking and heating.  
About one-quarter of global liquid biofuels were produced in the LAC in 2024. Biofuels 
account for over 10% of energy consumption in transport, compared to a global average 
below 5%. In response to the 1973 oil crisis, Brazil introduced the Pró-Álcool programme to 
produce bioethanol to reduce reliance on gasoline imports and bolster domestic supply 
security. Around 85% of the car fleet in Brazil today consists of flex fuel vehicles that can 
operate with high levels of ethanol blending: Brazil is the largest producer and consumer of 
biofuels in the region, and the second-largest producer of liquid biofuels worldwide. 
Argentina and Colombia are emerging as prominent suppliers. 
In the STEPS, modern bioenergy use increases by around 30% by 2035, helping to meet a 
growing share of energy demand (Figure 8.11). Biofuel mandates in Argentina, Brazil and 
Colombia increase the share of modern bioenergy in their overall energy supply mixes: use 
of liquid biofuels ramps up significantly, and in relative terms, so does the use of biogases.

There is also scope to ramp up biogas production. Brazil has the largest potential for biogas 
supply in the world, but its annual production remains relatively small, around 0.7 billion 
cubic metres of natural gas equivalent (bcme). Most of its biogas production is from landfill 
sites, but there is potential to make use of vinasse, which is a by-product from the ethanol 
industry, and to step up use of sustainable feedstocks such as crop residues and animal 
manure that remain largely untapped (Figure 8.12).The quota obligations in the new Fuel of 
the Future law in Brazil are likely to stimulate growth in biogas production.  
In addition to its energy value, biogas production offers several co-benefits. Digestate, a 
nutrient-rich by-product of biogas production, can be used as a fertiliser, while upgrading 
biogas to biomethane produces a pure stream of biogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) which can be 
captured and stored, or used in industry such as food and beverage production.

source and country in LAC in the STEPS, 2024-2035

Biogas production is set to significantly increase,  
yet much feedstock potential remains untapped in 2035  
Note: bcme = billion cubic metres of natural gas equivalent; LAC = Latin America and the Caribbean; 
Other LAC = Other countries in LAC. 
The average cost of producing biomethane in the region is around USD 23 per gigajoule (GJ), 
which is somewhat higher than end-user prices for natural gas in most LAC countries. 
Incentives for biomethane production could create new jobs, improve waste management 
and reduce the need to import natural gas. Improving access to infrastructure such as natural 
gas networks could help increase demand by broadening the potential market for 
biomethane. In Brazil, the Special Incentive Regime for Infrastructure Development already 
includes biomethane within the types of projects eligible for tax exemptions for materials 
and equipment.

European Union 
8.4.1 Key energy trends  
The European Union has ambitious energy and climate targets for 2030 which include a net 
reduction of 55% in GHG emissions, deployment of 600 GW of new solar PV, and a reduction 
in total final consumption of 11.7% compared with the levels in the European Commission 
EU Reference Scenario 2020. These targets aim to meet EU climate goals as well as to 
improve energy security and competitiveness by reducing dependence on expensive 
imported fossil fuels. The downside risks of such dependence were underscored in the 
aftermath of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine when natural gas pipeline deliveries from 
Russia were cut, sparking an energy crisis. Despite government support for energy bills 
waning, average residential energy prices in the European Union have fallen slightly since the 
crisis, but they remain over 20% above their 2010-2019 average.

Notes: EJ = exajoule; NG = Natural gas. Other includes geothermal, marine and solar thermal. The climate 
pledges pathway outlines a trajectory towards the European Union achieving its long-term climate goals. 
EU plans for a clean energy transition are predicated on developing cost-competitive sources 
of clean energy that reduce the share of fossil fuels in total final consumption. The power 
sector makes the biggest contribution to this goal as the share of renewables in the 
generation mix rises, with coal demand in 2035 falling to nearly one-ninth of today’s level in 
the STEPS, and natural gas demand falling by over 40 bcm. Gas demand declines by 14% by 
2035 in the buildings sector as more heat pumps are installed, and by 12% in the industry 
sector as efficiency improves. Oil demand declines as well, with the uptake of EVs cutting

demand by close to 2 mbd/year in the STEPS by 2035. Meeting the EU long-term climate 
pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 requires a further 25% reduction in the use of 
fossil fuels from the level projected in the STEPS in 2035 (Figure 8.13). 
The European Union decarbonisation trajectory relies heavily on its electricity system. Its 
system is interconnected and strong, but has faced some recent setbacks, including a 
blackout on the Iberian Peninsula (Box 8.2). The share of fossil fuels in generation dropped 
below 30% in 2024, below the combined share of solar PV and wind, and there has been a 
uptick in support for nuclear power in several EU member states: Belgium voted to keep its 
reactors online and to allow the construction of new ones; France plans to provide a loan to 
cover at least half of the construction costs for six nuclear reactors; and Italy announced 
plans to consider the reintroduction of nuclear power. In the STEPS, electricity generation 
increases by 40% and its share of final consumption by nine percentage points from the 
current level by 2035. Energy storage, market reform and grid expansion are needed to 
support the transition in the EU electricity sector. In the STEPS, grid investment almost 
doubles by 2035 compared to today. These investments have the potential to accelerate 
renewables integration and affordability for end-users, though consumers face very different 
electricity prices, depending on their country. For example, the average German household 
paid almost four-times higher electricity prices than the average Hungarian household in the 
second-half of 2024, driven by different market fundamentals, policies and subsidy levels.  
The new EU NDC targets a cut of 66.25-72.5% in GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2035, in 
line with the goal of a 90% reduction below 1990 levels by 2040, agreed by EU Environment 
Ministers in November 2025. In addition to measures to increase the electrification of end-
uses, boost the share of low-emissions fuels in the power sector and improve efficiency, deep 
decarbonisation also requires making meaningful inroads into hard-to-abate sectors such as 
energy-intensive industry. Success will depend on the effectiveness of emerging strategies: 
for instance, in 2025 the European Union announced an intention to mobilise EUR 100 billion 
(USD 108 billion) to support industry decarbonisation as part of its Clean Industrial Deal. This 
funding can be used to support novel mechanisms, like the planned EUR 1 billion 
(USD 1.1 billion) EU-wide fixed premium auction related to decarbonising industrial process 
heat and is in addition to funding from individual member states, like the EUR 4 billion 
(USD 4.3 billion) allocated to carbon contracts for difference in Germany. 
Box 8.2 ⊳ 
Iberian blackout: lessons learned  
On 28 April 2025, the Iberian Peninsula suffered a widespread blackout that interrupted 
electricity supply across Spain, Portugal and parts of southern France, affecting over 
50 million people. According to the ENTSO-E factual report, the event was triggered by a 
rapid sequence of technical failures (ENTSO-E, 2025). In the minutes before the blackout, 
the electricity system became unstable, with unusual swings in voltage and power flows. 
This instability was followed by a sharp rise in voltage as generators that had been 
absorbing reactive power were erroneously shut down by protection systems, even 
though voltage levels had not yet exceeded thresholds defined by regulation. As more 
plants disconnected, the voltage rose further, leading to a cascade of additional

8 
shutdowns. Hundreds of megawatts (MW) of smaller, distributed sources switched off 
unexpectedly, making it even more difficult for system operators to respond. Ultimately, 
the Iberian system was disconnected from the rest of Europe, and automatic safety 
systems could not prevent a complete collapse. Following the outage, the Spanish and 
Portuguese system operators, working with neighbouring system operators, moved to 
restore supply using black-start hydropower, thermal plants and imports from France. By 
the early morning of 29 April, all transmission substations were energised, and nearly all 
demand was met. 
The incident demonstrates that electricity security in modern power systems depends 
not only on generation but also on the quality of grid operation and the behaviour of all 
connected assets. This highlights the need for enforceable rules that require all 
generators to support the system during emergencies and to disconnect only if clearly 
defined thresholds are breached. Preparedness remains essential. The rapid restoration 
of power in the Iberian Peninsula was made possible by strong interconnections with 
neighbouring countries, robust emergency protocols and available black-start capability. 
Maintaining and strengthening these capabilities is crucial. 
The heightened international attention brought by the blackout provides an opportunity 
to revisit some common elements of electricity security and resilience as power systems 
evolve. While electricity systems and market structures differ from country to country, 
IEA analysis has identified four critical pillars that are necessary in every case (IEA, 2025b). 
First, robust grid infrastructure is vital, including strong networks and regional 
interconnections, as it provides the backbone for secure operations. Second, power 
system flexibility is essential to balance supply and demand, which includes demand-side 
response, storage and the maintenance of dispatchable generation, as well as measures 
to ensure that markets appropriately value these services. Third, technical solutions, such 
as synchronous condensers or batteries equipped with grid-forming inverters, are 
needed to support system stability as the generation mix evolves. Forth, it is crucial to 
adapt operational frameworks as power systems transform by updating grid codes, 
reserve requirements, balancing mechanisms and regulatory structures to keep pace 
with new challenges and technologies. 
8.4.2 How can industrial heat pumps deliver competitiveness and 
decarbonisation?  
Improving competitiveness is central to EU economic growth. Non-energy-intensive 
industries play an important role: while they consume 30% of energy in industry, they 
account for around 80% of the value it adds to the economy. Electrification in non-energy-
intensive industries in the European Union has flatlined since 2015 at similar levels to the 
United States, and at much lower levels than major industrial hubs in Asia (Figure 8.14). 
Industrial heat pumps (IHPs) are a key technology for electrification of low and medium 
temperature processes: they use one-third to one-fifth of the energy of conventional boilers 
and do not rely directly on fossil fuels. Using IHPs for electrification is an effective way to

decarbonise, improve competitiveness, and reduce import dependence (the region imports 
over 90% of its oil and almost 85% of its natural gas). The EU Industrial Clean Deal recognises 
the importance of electrification, aiming to raise the economy-wide electrification rate to 
32% by 2030.

Despite importing most of its fossil fuels, the EU has seen the share of electrification in non-
energy-intensive industries flatline; to meet climate pledges, this share needs to increase 
Notes: USD/GJ = US dollar per gigajoule. The EU climate pledges pathway outlines a trajectory towards the 
European Union achieving its long-term climate goals. 
Low electricity prices help drive electrification, but current prices are both volatile and high 
by historical standards. Natural gas set the day-ahead wholesale electricity price around 60% 
of the time, despite generating only 20% of electricity in 2022 (European Commission, 2024). 
Moreover, electricity taxes in most EU member states are high relative to gas and to other 
regions. Despite these hurdles, IHPs are competitive with gas based on current EU average 
industry end-use prices; regional price variation makes the advantage stronger in some 
member states than others (Figure 8.15). The superior efficiency of IHPs relative to gas 
boilers translates into lower operating costs which can mean lower lifetime costs, even 
though IHPs involve higher upfront capital expenditure. Industrial consumers with IHPs can 
reduce exposure to price volatility by using a power purchase agreement or reduce costs by 
curtailing heat production when prices are high, provided that suitable demand-side 
flexibility mechanisms are in place.  
Electric boilers, which are less efficient than IHPs, could also be competitive if used flexibly 
because they require comparatively little upfront capital spending. Flexibility could be 
achieved through the use of thermal storage or by electrifying only part of a fleet of gas 
boilers, which could also reduce grid connection costs by lowering the required connection 
capacity. Using electricity flexibly opens new opportunities, including to accrue secondary

revenue from ancillary services, and the chance to exploit negative wholesale prices, which 
are increasingly common in some EU markets: for example, they applied for almost 10% of 
the time in Finland in 2024.

end-user prices for industrial consumers in the Europe Union

Since 2022, electricity has been an economical source of heat  
for industry compared to gas, yet heat pump installation remains at a low level 
Notes: MBtu = million British thermal unit; MWh = megawatt-hours; PPA = power purchase agreement; Q4 = 
fourth quarter. PPA price shown reflects the EU-wide average of deals, not including transmission or 
distribution charges. The coefficient of performance for the industrial heat pump is 3.5. Demand flexibility of 
20% requires curtailing electric heating during the 20% of hours with the highest power price.  
Despite their cost effectiveness in recent years, IHPs have made limited progress. High initial 
capital outlays which take a long time to recoup are a major barrier. IHP installation may also 
require facilities to reconfigure service utilities, further increasing cost and complexity. Policy 
can help ameliorate these challenges: the carbon contracts for difference auction by the 
German government in 2024 was mainly won by electrification projects, and industrial 
electricity prices may fall further there under a plan to subsidise electricity bills for industry. 
There are also examples from further afield that could serve as a blueprint for the European 
Union. In New Zealand, where policy has underpinned growth in IHPs, about one-quarter of 
the potential has been captured: assistance was provided to help with upfront costs, and a 
support programme addressed concerns about engineering expertise.  
Spot prices for natural gas are not the only factor affecting electrification: energy security 
plays a key role. Motivated by energy security considerations as well climate goals, the 
European Union has a target for renewables to provide at least 42.5% of the energy mix by 
2030, and in tandem its action plan for grids aims to add 64 GW of cross-border transmission 
between 2025 and 2030. These plans indicate a strong commitment to electricity security, 
and are likely to boost electrification, including the adoption of IHPs.

Africa 
8.5.1 Key energy trends 
Securing investment to expand domestic energy provision is a primary energy challenge in 
Africa. Over the last decade financing fell for export-oriented oil and gas projects, but 
investment rebounded since 2021, led by increases in spending on domestic energy 
infrastructure, especially in the power sector. This trend continues in the STEPS, with total 
energy investment by 2035 returning close to highs last seen in 2015 (Figure 8.16). However, 
investment levels in the STEPS still fall short of meeting basic energy needs. 
Chapter 6 explores what it would take to achieve universal access to modern energy in Africa 
by 2040, including the implications for investment. 
Figure 8.16 ⊳ Energy investment by target area in Africa, 2015-2024, and in the 
STEPS to 2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Energy investment fell after 2015 as oil and gas projects slowed, though it has rebound 
since 2021with domestic energy developments and new oil and gas projects 
Note: MER = market exchange rate. 
Efforts to progress modern energy access are gaining renewed momentum. The majority of 
Africans without access live in countries that have introduced new policies since 2024. 
Accordingly, the number of people gaining access to clean cooking by 2035 accelerates to 
24 million per year in the STEPS, and begins to outpace population growth by 2030. Liquefied 
petroleum gas (LPG) plays the biggest role to extend access for cooking, with an increase in 
demand of 150 thousand barrels per day (kb/d) by 2035. Around 20 million people per year 
gain access to electricity to 2035 in the STEPS – a rate of progress 25% higher than in the 
2010s.

Meeting rising electricity demand requires a major expansion of power systems in Africa. An 
average of 24 GW of new capacity is added each year to 2035 in the STEPS, which is double 
the rate seen over the past decade. More than 70% of these additions are renewables, with 
solar PV alone accounting for half. Solar PV is the cheapest new source of electricity in most 
African countries, and its expansion is further aided by a sharp increase in solar panel imports 
from China as excess PV panel manufacturers cultivate new markets. Solar PV overtakes 
hydropower as the second-largest electricity source by 2035 (Figure 8.17). Natural gas 
remains the largest source of electricity, helping to support grid reliability in sub-Saharan 
Africa. Coal continues to contribute to the generation mix, and nuclear power development 
gains momentum. In Egypt, the El Dabaa plant – North Africa’s first nuclear power facility – 
is expected to reach full capacity by 2030. Many African countries have plans to diversify 
their generation mix, and these have been given added impetus by the recent crippling 
hydropower shortages. Grid networks expand in the STEPS, with an average of 
190 000 kilometres (km) added each year to 2035, a 40% increase from the current level.

Notes: EJ = exajoule; TWh = terawatt-hour. Other includes geothermal and solar thermal. 
Africa sees an uptick in oil and gas investment activity in the STEPS. Incumbent oil producers 
such as Libya, Algeria and Nigeria see production remain broadly flat against a backdrop of 
higher OPEC+ production allowances; new exporters such as Uganda and Senegal are coming 
online; and Namibia begins adding barrels in the mid-2030s. The net result is that oil 
production in Africa remains broadly stable to 2035, accounting for 7-8% of the global total. 
Meanwhile natural gas production rises from 240 bcm in 2024 to around 260 bcm by 2035, 
when it accounts for over 5% of the global total. Production in Algeria and Egypt remains

of the increase comes from its offshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. 
8.5.2 Opportunities to step up the mineral supply chain in Africa  
Africa holds 80% of global reserves of platinum-group metals and phosphate, over 55% of 
cobalt and chromium reserves, at least 25% of global reserves of manganese, bauxite and 
graphite, 20% of uranium and 10% of copper reserves. These minerals are critically important 
for a variety of energy technologies and for other industries. This geological wealth offers a 
path for African countries to move beyond their historical role as exporters of raw materials. 
Today, however, most of the mineral resources are exported directly as ore or in semi-
processed forms to be refined overseas. For instance, the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(DRC) accounted for two-thirds of global mined production of cobalt in 2024, but nearly all 
its output is exported with minimal processing: most of it goes to China, where it is refined 
into battery-grade material. This pattern is replicated across many other minerals, with few 
exceptions. 
Some countries have decided to encourage domestic value added by following the example 
of Indonesia and prohibiting the export of unprocessed ores. For example, Zimbabwe 
introduced tighter controls on lithium extraction and exports in 2023, and in May 2025 
Gabon announced its intention to ban the export of raw manganese ore from January 2029. 
Whatever the policy intention, the effectiveness of export bans is highly contingent on 
specific national and market conditions, and few countries have the market power to make 
this an effective strategy.  
Moving successfully into downstream activities to increase the economic value of mineral 
resource endowments depends on the development of cost-effective local processing 
capabilities. Moving from raw ore to processed outputs captures a large part of the value 
added in the mineral supply chain, and stepping up the value chain in this way can be a 
catalyst for a virtuous cycle of industrialisation that results in higher value exports, additional 
skilled employment and lasting economic resilience. A domestic mineral processing industry 
can also stimulate investment in local energy infrastructure to meet the demand it creates. 
If the enabling factors are favourable and policy and investment frameworks are in place, 
Africa could play a key role in the global supply of concentrates and refined minerals. To 
demonstrate this potential, we considered a representative portfolio of Africa’s resource 
endowments: copper, cobalt, graphite, nickel, manganese and phosphate. The DRC and 
Zambia hold substantial copper and cobalt resources: refined copper is an essential 
component for many energy technologies and the broader economy, while battery-grade 
cobalt is used in the cathodes of nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) type lithium-ion batteries. 
NMC batteries also require refined manganese and nickel, and these metals are produced in 
South Africa, Gabon and Madagascar. Morocco could leverage its vast phosphate reserves to 
expand production of purified phosphoric acid, which is a key input for lithium-iron 
phosphate (LFP) batteries. Similarly, the graphite mined in Mozambique and Madagascar 
could be upgraded into spherical graphite, the processed anode material required for nearly 
all types of lithium-ion batteries.

We examined plausible pathways to increase domestic refining of the various minerals. Some 
60% of its mined copper is already refined in Africa, which produced 9% of global refined 
copper output in 2024, and this could be increased to 80% by 2040 (Figure 8.18). Similarly, 
about 55% of its nickel production is refined in Africa today, though the overall volume 
remains small. This could rise to over 65% in 2040, boosting its market value by around 10% 
even as mine output remains stable. In the case of cobalt, refining in Africa could increase 
from 3% of mined output today to 13% in 2040, increasing refined output by 2.5-times to 
16 thousand tonnes (kt). Battery-grade graphite production could rise from today’s very low 
levels to reach 130 kt in 2040.  
Figure 8.18 ⊳ Market value of selected minerals and share of minerals refined 
in Africa in 2024 and potential in 2040 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
If domestic refining is strategically scaled up, the combined market value of key minerals 
could increase by three-quarters between today and 2040 to reach USD 120 billion 
Notes: Values in 2024 US dollars (USD). Percentage refined indicates volume share of mine output that is 
refined in Africa. Refined phosphate expressed in P2O5 content. Graphite refers to battery-grade spherical 
graphite. 
At current price levels, the result would be to increase the total market value of these 
minerals by nearly three-quarters from around USD 70 billion today to USD 120 billion in 
2040. This takes account of projected changes in mined output, which declines in some cases, 
as well as the proportion of ore that is already refined in Africa. Refined phosphate could 
account for an additional USD 39 billion of value in 2040 compared to 2024. Refined cobalt 
could increase in value by more than USD 300 million, though this would not fully offset the 
decrease in mined production. (Further details can be found in the recently published report 
Stepping Up the Value Chain in Africa: Minerals, materials and manufacturing (IEA, 2025c)

Middle East  
8.6.1 Key energy trends  
The Middle East is a major producer and consumer of energy. It contains five of the world’s 
top-ten oil producing countries, i.e. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, 
and three of the top-ten natural gas producers, i.e. Iran, Qatar and Saudi Arabia (Figure 8.19). 
Oil production by OPEC+ countries, seven of which are in the Middle East, has increased since 
the start of 2025 as the bloc unwinds production cuts agreed in 2023. Those Middle East 
countries that are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council have high per capita energy 
consumption and income levels: they account for nearly 60% of the region’s GDP in 
purchasing power parity (PPP) terms and over half of energy demand while making up just 
over a fifth of the regional population. Parts of the Middle East face geopolitical instability 
and conflict, and this inevitably affects their energy and economic outlook. 
Figure 8.19 ⊳ Oil and natural gas relative to global production and energy 
demand by source in the Middle East in the STEPS, 2010-2035 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Oil and gas production in the Middle East account for a significant share of total global 
hydrocarbon output, and these sources also meet nearly all energy demand in the region  
Notes: EJ = exajoule. Other energy demand includes bioenergy and waste, coal, solar thermal, hydro and wind. 
Natural gas and oil meet 56% and 41% of the region’s energy demand respectively, compared 
to global averages of 23% and 30%. The shares vary by country: for example, over 70% of 
energy demand in Iran is met by gas, and over 90% in Qatar, whereas over 80% of energy 
demand in both Yemen and Lebanon is met by oil. Per capita energy demand in the region 
varies widely among countries, but for the region as a whole it is more than twice the average 
of emerging market and developing economies. Several factors contribute to the high level 
of energy demand. Abundant energy resources combined with energy subsidies make oil and

natural gas affordable and accessible in some Middle Eastern countries, while the presence 
of energy-intensive petrochemical industries, often integrated with refineries, drives energy 
consumption in industry. At 143 cars per 1 000 people, the ownership rate is about 45% 
higher than the average of emerging market and developing economies, reflecting relatively 
high average incomes in some countries. Space cooling needs are substantial because of the 
hot climate. In addition, most countries in the region face water stress or scarcity and turn 
to desalination where it is financially feasible.  
Figure 8.20 ⊳ Electricity demand by end-use and generation by source in the 
Middle East in the STEPS, 2010-2035 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
The electricity outlook shows a decline in the share of oil in generation and a rise in 
demand driven in large part by space cooling, appliances and desalination  
Notes: TWh = terawatt-hour. The difference between generation and demand reflects transmission and 
distribution losses, own use in the power sector and net imports. Other in demand includes transport and 
hydrogen production. Other in electricity generation includes bioenergy, coal and hydropower. 
Energy demand in the Middle East increased at an annual rate of 2.6% between 2010 and 
2024. This slows to an annual average of 1.8% to 2035 in the STEPS, and to 2.4% in the CPS. 
Natural gas demand rises 30% by 2035 in the STEPS, while oil demand declines marginally. 
Electricity consumption rises faster than overall energy demand in both scenarios (IEA, 
2025d). Today, 64% of electricity used in the Middle East is consumed in commercial and 
residential buildings, and 4% in desalination. Around 80% of the world’s thermal desalination 
plants, i.e. those using oil and gas, are in the Middle East, but there has been a shift in recent 
years towards more efficient electrified desalination technologies, notably reverse osmosis. 
Electricity demand for desalination increases by more than a factor of 2.5 in the STEPS by 
2035. Despite this rapid increase in energy demand from desalination, space cooling is the 
largest end-use driver of electricity demand growth to 2035 (Figure 8.20). Although their 
share of the market is still very small, EVs are gaining ground in parts of the region. In Jordan, 
for example, EVs accounted for over 50% of new passenger car sales in 2024.

8.6.2 Synergies between increasing cooling demand and renewables uptake  
The Middle East is among the hottest regions in the world, with temperatures regularly 
exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (°C) in the summer. As temperatures rise further, cooling 
degree days – a measure of cooling needs - are projected to increase by 10% by 2035. 
Electricity demand for space cooling nearly doubled between 2010 and 2024, from 166 TWh 
to over 300 TWh today: cooling now accounts for about a quarter of overall electricity 
demand in the region. Electricity consumption patterns are strongly influenced by the 
weather, especially in the summer season. When temperatures are at their highest, cooling 
can be responsible for nearly 50% of the peak electricity load. 
Figure 8.21 ⊳ Annual electricity load curve and peak cooling demand by 
driver in the Middle East in the STEPS, 2024-2035

Space cooling drives variations in electricity demand over the year  
and accounts for a large share of peak demand 
Notes: GW = gigawatt; AC = air conditioning. Insulation includes all measures to improve the energy 
performance of the building envelope. Hourly demand profiles reflect the reduction in demand during 
Ramadan, which was in March-April in 2024 and is scheduled for November in 2035. 
Space cooling demand increases by a further 140 TWh by 2035 in the STEPS and by nearly 
160 TWh in the CPS. This growth is driven by an increase in floorspace, rising air conditioner 
ownership and higher temperatures, and tempered by efficiency improvements in air 
conditioners and better insulation (Figure 8.21). Several countries in the Middle East have 
policies to moderate cooling demand: most countries in the region have minimum energy 
performance standards for air conditioners, and countries including Jordan and Lebanon are 
developing national cooling action plans. In the United Arab Emirates, regulations limit the 
minimum temperature setting for air conditioners to 20 °C.

Peak electricity demand in the Middle East rises by around 40% in the STEPS by 2035 
compared to today, underscoring the importance of system adequacy for electricity security 
and the need for additional investment. Today, energy investment in the Middle East 
amounts to 6% of GDP, which is twice the global average. Around 78% of investment is 
expected to go to fossil fuels in 2025, compared to a global average of 35%. This share falls 
to 66% by 2035 in the STEPS as investment in grids, storage and low-emissions electricity 
increase. 
Figure 8.22 ⊳ Average summer daily electricity consumption with and without 
space cooling flexibility in the Middle East in the STEPS, 2035

Cooling flexibility can be harnessed to align demand with renewables energy generation 
Notes: GW = gigawatt; h = hours. Residual load is the difference between electricity demand and renewables 
generation. 
Space cooling drives the peak electricity demand growth in the Middle East, yet it also 
presents an opportunity to support the integration of renewables power generation. The 
ability to shift cooling loads over time can be used to decrease the daily variation in residual 
load, defined as total electricity demand minus renewable generation. Reducing the 
magnitude of these variations is crucial to lower operational stress on dispatchable power 
sources required to balance the networks. Depending on the thermal inertia1 of buildings, 
cooling demand loads can be shifted by a period of between a few dozen minutes to several 
hours, or even more in combination with thermal storage systems, such as water tanks. This 
can shift electricity consumption closer to midday, thereby enabling electricity systems to 
benefit from peak solar PV generation and avoid curtailment (Figure 8.22). By 2035, over 15% 
of electricity in the Middle East comes from solar PV in the STEPS, and 5% from other 
renewable sources including wind.

Eurasia  
8.7.1 Key energy trends 
Eurasia is both a major consumer and producer of fossil fuels. In 2024, fossil fuels met 90% 
of energy demand in the region, the second-highest regional average after the Middle East. 
Eurasia is also a large net exporter of fossil fuels, selling around 200 bcm of natural gas in 
2024, along with 7 mb/d of oil and 130 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) of coal. Russia 
accounts for around 70% of its oil and gas exports, although these have been significantly 
affected by unilateral cuts to supply as well as sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine: 
in 2024, Russian natural gas exports were 45% below their pre-war level of 250 bcm. 
Several announcements were made by Caspian and Central Asian countries during the COP29 
in Baku, including commitments to increase support for renewables and to improve 
infrastructure links. An example is the Trans-Caspian Green Energy Corridor that was the 
subject of a Strategic Partnership Agreement signed by Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and 
Uzbekistan to integrate their power grids and export renewable energy. However, change in 
the energy sector has been slow in most cases. Ageing building stock and industrial facilities, 
undermaintained pipelines that transport fuel over large distances, and a cold climate mean 
that the regional energy intensity of GDP is 40% higher than the global average. This 
inefficiency translates into high energy costs, heavy environmental burdens and increased 
vulnerability to supply disruptions.  
Ukraine – part of the Europe grouping in our modelling – has historically had strong ties with 
the Eurasian energy space. However, together with Moldova, it now has its sights set firmly 
on integration with the broader European energy system. Ukraine faces an especially 
daunting set of energy challenges, with Russia systematically targeting its energy assets 
during the war. Ukraine is now exploring a shift towards a more decentralised power system. 
This is being driven in the first instance by security considerations, but it could become the 
blueprint for a very different configuration of energy infrastructure in the longer term.  
Natural gas is the largest contributor to the energy mix in the region and is emblematic of 
some of its dilemmas. Gas can be an enabler of change in many circumstances: it can, for 
example, replace fuels with higher emissions intensities and provide system flexibility that 
helps integrate new sources of low-emissions power. However, the gas sector in many parts 
of Eurasia is not playing this role: infrastructure is generally in poor condition, prices are often 
subsidised in ways that encourage wasteful consumption and undercut the competitiveness 
of alternatives, and high levels of methane leaks compromise the environmental case for gas 
use. Moreover, with few exceptions, gas resources in the region typically need long-distance 
pipelines to reach export markets, and this can put them at a disadvantage at a time when 
consumers appear to prefer the optionality and flexibility of LNG. 
In the STEPS, total energy demand growth in Eurasia averages 0.2% per year through to 2050, 
among the lowest rate of growth in emerging market and developing countries. It is 
marginally higher in the CPS, but the overall amount of growth over the entire projection

period, around 4 EJ, is still equivalent to just four years of average demand growth in 
Southeast Asia in the same scenario.  
The energy mix is projected to remain static in both scenarios. Fossil fuels currently account 
for 90% of the energy mix in Eurasia and remains around that level in both scenarios by 2050 
(Figure 8.23). Oil demand rises 0.5 mb/d by 2035 in the STEPS as a result of growth in the 
transport and industry sectors. Natural gas demand increases by 30 bcm over the same 
period: this mostly reflects increased demand in power and industry. More than half of the 
increase in electricity consumption in the STEPS to 2035 is met by natural gas. Renewables 
capacity nearly doubles between 2024 and 2050, which is the lowest regional rate of growth 
in the STEPS. Hydropower remains the dominant source of renewables electricity in 2050.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Energy supply balance in Eurasia is similar in both scenarios,  
with natural gas dominating the energy mix 
Note: EJ = exajoule. 
Although the pace of change in Eurasia is slow, there are countries that have moved or are 
moving to diversify their energy and electricity mix. Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Georgia are 
large and established producers of hydropower. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are expanding 
their use of renewables, with the focus mainly on solar PV but also wind. Following its hosting 
of the COP29, Azerbaijan is seeking to step up investment in low-emissions technologies, and 
it aims to increase the share of renewables in installed capacity to 30% by 2030.  
Nuclear energy also plays an important and growing role in many countries in Eurasia. Russia 
is a leading exporter of nuclear technology, and Rosatom is looking to expand co-operation 
in this area with countries in Central Asia. Kazakhstan is also the largest global producer of 
uranium, with a market share of around 40%.

8.7.2 Prospects for Russian natural gas exports  
Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine threw its natural gas export strategy into disarray. 
Before the invasion, the official expectation was for steady growth in exports, with the 
established European market being supplemented over time by more diversified flows of 
LNG and pipeline gas, mainly to China and other destinations in Asia. Its previous Energy 
Strategy foresaw that Russia would be exporting more than 300 bcm of gas by 2024. 
The actual figure for 2024 is estimated to be less than 160 bcm, and the push for new markets 
has become a strategic necessity for Russia in light of the huge drop in volumes sent to 
Europe. The new Russian Energy Strategy, adopted in 2025, is less ambitious than the 
previous one, but is nonetheless considerably more bullish than our projections. It foresees 
exports of between 320-375 bcm by the mid-2030s, compared to around 150 bcm in the 
STEPS (Figure 8.24).  
Figure 8.24 ⊳ Natural gas pipeline and LNG exports from Russia by scenario 
relative to the 2025 Energy Strategy targets, 2024, 2030 and 2050  
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Russia struggles to find export outlets for natural gas, with both pipeline  
and LNG trade through to 2050 well below government targets  
Note: bcm = billion cubic metres. 
There are four main avenues for Russian gas export: pipeline exports to Europe, China and 
Central Asia; and exports of LNG. Each of these faces market and political uncertainties.  
Russian exports of gas to Europe consist mainly of deliveries to the European Union, Türkiye, 
Belarus, Moldova and the Balkan countries. In the STEPS, exports to Türkiye remain above 
20 bcm, and volumes to other non-EU markets remain flat, but deliveries to the European 
Union fall to less than 10 bcm by 2030 as the Council adopted measures to phase out Russian 
LNG imports by 2027. Even in the event of a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine, we do not

anticipate Russian gas returning to Europe at scale, especially given a relatively comfortable 
global supply balance in the second half of the 2020s. The loss of the European market has 
led Russia to look elsewhere for customers, including countries in Central Asia that already 
have pipeline connections. Exports to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have picked up, and a 15-
year deal was recently concluded with the smaller Central Asian market of Kyrgyzstan. 
Consumption of Russian gas in Central Asia is not projected to exceed 10-20 bcm per year, 
but Central Asia could also act as a conduit for Russian exports to Iran and potentially also to 
China, although the volumes are not projected to be high. 
Russian pipeline gas exports to China along the Power of Siberia-1 route reached their 
envisaged capacity of 38 bcm/year in 2025, and recent discussions have explored the 
possibility of increasing throughput capacity up to 44 bcm/year. A contract for an extra 
10 bcm/year to bring gas from Sakhalin to Northeast China was signed in 2022, the so-called 
Far Eastern route, and there are prospects for a marginal increase in capacity on this line. 
Deliveries are scheduled from 2027, but they could slip by a few years.  
A larger uncertainty relates to the negotiations on an additional large-scale pipeline, Power 
of Siberia-2, which would bring up to 50 bcm/year of gas from the main resource base in 
Western Siberia to China. This pipeline is assumed to go ahead in the CPS but not in the 
STEPS: the Chinese market already looks well supplied without it in this scenario. But this 
could change if the politics align, or if Russia is ready to cede ground in price negotiations. If 
it goes ahead in the STEPS and comes into operation in the early 2030s, it would prolong the 
period of well supplied global gas markets and undercut the commercial rationale for further 
expansion of LNG export projects, including those planned in Russia. 
The new Russian Energy Strategy has LNG exports reaching 142 bcm by 2030, up by 100 bcm 
from today. Achieving this in practice will be extremely challenging; this target is 
considerably higher than the volumes reached in both the CPS and STEPS. Hurdles include 
the sanctions that limit access to western LNG technologies, finance and markets, and a 
shortage of LNG tankers that can operate in ice-bound Arctic waters. Russia is looking to 
relieve the latter constraint through domestically produced technologies and tankers, but 
these will take time to develop to the required performance standards. Even if these hurdles 
can be overcome, there are additional commercial obstacles in a fiercely competitive market, 
given that the second-half of this decade will see unprecedented growth in export capacity 
in other countries, led by the United States and Qatar. 
Overall, our analysis suggests that Russia faces an uphill struggle to re-establish its pre-
eminence among global gas exporters, despite very competitive upstream costs. Russia’s 
share of internationally traded gas, which stood at nearly 25% in 2021 before the invasion of 
Ukraine, never approaches these levels again in any scenario, and falls to 10 % by 2035 in the 
STEPS. This has implications for gas revenues, which decline from an average of 
USD 120 billion per year in the 2010s to USD 28 billion per year in the STEPS in the 2030s, 
and for Russia’s influence as a global energy player. The downside risks for Russian gas 
outlook intensify in scenarios that see accelerated action to bring down emissions.

China  
8.8.1 Key energy trends  
In 2024, GDP per capita in China stood at USD 27 000 in purchasing power parity terms. China 
is set to graduate to high income status in 2025. Its economic growth thus far has been 
energy intensive: its GDP per capita is 10% above the world average, but its per capita energy 
consumption is 50% above. In this Outlook, GDP grows 3.5% per year to 2035. Output levels 
of established industries like steel and cement have peaked and continue to decline in our 
projections: other energy-intensive industry products such as chemicals, petrochemicals and 
non-ferrous metals rise, but GDP is increasingly driven by services and high value-added 
manufacturing. This structural trend, alongside continued efficiency and electrification, leads 
to a peak and plateau in energy consumption in China (Figure 8.25). This marks an important 
trend break after years of rapid growth. 
Figure 8.25 ⊳ Energy demand by source and final consumption by sector in 
China in the STEPS, 2010-2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
After years of rapid growth, energy consumption is set to peak and plateau in the next few 
years, driven by structural economic change, electrification and efficiency  
Note: EJ = exajoule; CPS = Current Policies Scenario; EI industries = energy-intensive industries. 
The structure of energy supply and consumption in China sees substantial shifts by 2035 in 
the STEPS. It already has one of the highest shares of electricity in final consumption in the 
world, and this rises from its current level of 27% to 35% by 2035. China adds on average 
460 GW of wind and solar PV per year in the decade to 2035. When other renewables and 
nuclear are added in, low-emissions sources expand in total by around 600 TWh per year. By 
2035, China generates over 10 000 TWh of low-emissions electricity, and its total energy 
supply from renewables and nuclear is 10% larger than supply from oil and natural gas 
combined.

In the decade to 2024, China was responsible for more than two-thirds of global demand 
growth for oil. Its demand for oil declines by 2035 in the STEPS and CPS, and EVs have much 
to do with this trend. In 2024, nearly half of car sales in China were electric, of which two-
thirds were priced lower than their conventional equivalents. Their competitiveness sees 
electric cars rise to account for over 80% of sales by 2030 in the STEPS. The strong growth of 
high-speed rail also avoids oil demand (see Chapter 4, Box 4.1). As a result, oil demand for 
road transport in China starts to decline. By 2035, its total oil demand is around 15 mb/d or 
5% below today’s level (Figure 8.26). This is broadly in line with the projections of China’s oil 
major, Sinopec (Sinopec EDRI, 2025). The CPS sees little additional upside for total oil demand 
in China by 2035, given the competitiveness of EVs and policy commitment to them.

2010-2035

Oil demand peaks before 2030, curbed by EVs; gas demand rises,  
but electrification and energy efficiency limit the upside in key end-use sectors 
Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; bcm = billion cubic metres; CPS = Current Policies Scenario; EI industries = 
energy-intensive industries. 
China was responsible for nearly one-third of the global increase in demand for natural gas 
over the past decade. Demand continues to grow in both the STEPS and CPS but is limited by 
the electrification of end-uses. Industrial production in China is already highly electrified, 27% 
of industry energy consumption versus nearly 10% for gas. Electricity continues to gain 
ground in industry in the future. The transport sector sees increasing natural gas demand for 
trucks, over 25% of heavy-freight truck sales were natural gas fuelled in 2024, but it still 
accounts for a relatively small share of total gas demand. In the power sector, natural gas 
demand increases, but its growth potential is limited by competition with coal, pumped 
hydro and batteries, which play critical roles in balancing rising shares of variable 
renewables. The CPS sees a slightly higher upside for gas, with demand reaching 630 bcm by 
2035, an increase of 8% on the STEPS.

8.8.2 Future of coal in China: growth ahead or peak on the horizon? 
The massive electricity sector in China accounts for two-thirds of its coal demand. Industry is 
responsible for most of the remainder, but its demand for coal is declining: coal consumption 
in the industry sector peaked in 2014 and has since declined by 25%. Given that most 
industrial coal use is to produce cement and steel in China, the saturation of its housing and 
infrastructure needs means that demand for coal in industry will continue to decline. By 
2035, coal consumption in industry in China is a further 20% below the 2024 level in the 
STEPS. 
Therefore, the electricity sector will determine the future of coal in China. In the last five 
years, China has added more renewables and nuclear generation capacity than the rest of 
the world combined, and solar PV and wind now account for 18% of generation. Despite this, 
coal demand for electricity rose by more than 25% from 2019 to 2024 (Figure 8.27). As a 
result, coal consumption in the electricity sector reached 2 250 Mtce in 2024 (65 EJ). This is 
more than the total energy demand from all sources combined – coal, gas, nuclear, oil and 
renewables – of any other country in the world, except the United States.

versus energy demand, 2014-2024 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
From 2010 to 2024, the share of electricity generation in China’s coal demand 
 increased from 45 to 65%, driven by strong electricity demand growth  
Note: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent; GDP = gross domestic product. 
Economic growth in China has been very electricity-intensive in the post Covid pandemic 
period. Electricity consumption in the residential, industry and services sectors rose faster 
than economic activity in the 2019 to 2024 period. 
To integrate expanding shares of variable resources, China is investing in grids and 
dispatchable capacity, including batteries, pumped hydro and nuclear, as well as undertaking

reforms to incentivise flexibility, and a more grid-friendly deployment of renewables. 
However, it also has over 200 GW of coal generation capacity under construction. The low 
capital costs of coal plants in China means that operating them flexibly to support renewables 
has much lower opportunity costs than in other markets. Even at a 30% capacity factor, its 
average levelised cost of coal generation at USD 80 per megawatt-hour (MWh) is lower than 
the levelised cost of gas at USD 110/MWh. 
Figure 8.28 ⊳ Electricity generation from coal and renewables to 2035 by 
scenario and coal demand by scenario in China to 2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Coal demand peaks and declines by 20% in the STEPS, led by declines in coal-fired power 
generation; in the CPS, higher demand and lower renewables keep coal higher for longer  
Notes: TWh = terawatt-hour; Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent. Sinopec scenario results are from China 
Energy Outlook 2060 (Sinopec EDRI, 2025). 
Therefore, the outlook for coal in China is shaped by a three-way race between booming 
renewables growth, rising electricity demand, and efforts to make the grid more modern and 
flexible. How this race plays out differs in the STEPS and CPS, but the long-term trends point 
to a peak and decline (Figure 8.28). In the CPS, electricity demand is higher than in the STEPS 
by 2035: the CPS sees a lower level of electrification, but it also sees fewer of the efficiency 
gains that dampen demand growth in the STEPS. Capacity additions of renewables average 
around 480 GW per year in the STEPS, compared to around 450 GW per year in the CPS. 
Curtailment rises in the STEPS, but efforts to add more flexibility through battery storage, 
pumped hydro and grid capacity keep the curtailment rate far lower than in the CPS. Even 
with the higher levels of electricity demand seen in the CPS, China’s huge renewables 
manufacturing capacity and the economic competitiveness of renewables lead to sufficient 
growth in renewables capacity to put coal into decline. As a result, total coal demand falls by 
around 20% to 2035 in the STEPS and by around 10% in the CPS.

India  
8.9.1 Key energy trends  
India is the largest source of energy demand growth in the world in our Outlook. Energy 
demand increases by over 15 EJ by 2035 in the STEPS, which is nearly as much as the demand 
growth in China and all Southeast Asian countries combined. India is the largest contributor 
to growth in oil demand in this period, the second-largest for electricity generation and coal 
demand growth, and third-largest natural gas demand growth.  
Energy demand in India is being propelled by increasing economic activity. Between 2010 
and 2024, its GDP growth rate was second only to that of China among major countries and 
regions. In the period to 2035, GDP grows on average by 6.1% each year in India, which is 
more than any other major country or region, and its GDP per capita is 75% higher in 2035 
than today (see Chapter 2, Table 2.1). India is currently well below the global average on a 
range of key energy and economy-wide indictors, but it has been moving towards them, and 
it continues to do so over the next decade (Figure 8.29). India adds the equivalent of one 
Bangalore every year to its urban population to 2035, and its built floor space expands by 
40%. It also adds nearly 12 000 cars to its roads every day, and well over 250 million air 
conditioners to its homes over the next decade.

energy; reducing fossil fuel import dependence; improving the reliability of electricity 
supplies; reducing air pollution; and cutting GHG emissions. To meet its myriad energy sector 
challenges and ambitions, India has instituted a wide range of policies and programmes. 
A key challenge is to provide universal access to modern energy. India has made remarkable 
progress in improving energy access in recent decades, but nearly 20% of its population 
continues to rely in whole or in part on traditional biomass for cooking. The Pradhan Mantri 
Ujjwala Yojana policy seeks to address this by providing subsidies for LPG use for poor 
households.  
India has pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2070, and has adopted several short-term 
targets, one of which aims to increase non-fossil power generation capacity (section 8.9.2). 
Its long-term targets are supported by a goal to scale up nuclear power capacity to 100 GW 
by 2047 from 8 GW today, its plan to implement a carbon market for select industries in 
2026, and a biofuels mandate that has achieved an ethanol blending rate of 20% in gasoline 
in 2025 with a view to also displace oil imports.  
With policy support, solar PV and wind are the fastest growing sources of energy to 2050 in 
the STEPS, and reach nearly 20% of the energy mix, although coal and oil remain mainstays 
(Figure 8.30). Energy demand grows fastest in the industry and transport sectors, with 
industry alone accounting for over half of the demand increase by 2050. CO2 emissions in 
India peak around 2040 in the STEPS, and by 2050 they stand at around 3.4 gigatonnes (Gt) 
per year.

8.9.2 India hits 50% non-fossil power capacity target early: what is next? 
In support of its long-term objective of net zero emissions by 2070, in 2022 India announced 
an objective to increase the share of non-fossil sources in the power generation mix to 50% 
by 2030. India met this target for grid-connected capacity in 2025, five years ahead of 
schedule. In the STEPS, it meets it in 2026 even when auto-producers, which is production of 
electricity by a facility primarily for its own use, is included (Figure 8.31). This success was 
underpinned by surging investment in renewables. In 2015, every dollar invested in fossil 
power generation sources in India was broadly matched by a dollar invested in non-fossil 
sources, a 1:1 ratio. By 2025, this ratio had increased to 1:4 in favour of non-fossil sources. 
Solar PV alone has attracted USD 113 billion in cumulative investment in the past decade, 
compared with USD  112 billion for all fossil fuel power generation sources combined.  
Figure 8.31 ⊳ Installed power capacity and electricity generation by source in 
India in the STEPS, 2015-2035  
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
India has achieved its target of 50% non-fossil power generation capacity ahead of its 
target year of 2030 by 2035, non-fossil sources contribute to over half of generation 
Notes: GW = gigawatt; TWh = terawatt-hour. Excludes battery storage and includes auto-producers.  
The share of non-fossil sources in installed generation capacity rises to 60% in 2030 and 70% 
in 2035 in the STEPS, and accounts for over 95% of capacity increases to 2035. This is a 
striking contrast to the 2015-2024 period, when coal and natural gas accounted for over 70% 
of increased generation. Nevertheless, led by industry, demand for coal rises moderately to 
2035, and coal continues to be a mainstay in the electricity generation mix, providing 
valuable dispatchable generation and flexibility. Solar PV and wind power see their share of 
generation rise from 11% today to over 25% by 2030 and to nearly 40% by 2035. Generation 
from nuclear triples by 2035. As a result, non-fossil sources are responsible for over half of 
electricity generation in India by 2035 in the STEPS. This reduces the carbon intensity of

electricity generation by nearly 45% to around 400 grammes of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-
hour, which narrows India’s gap with the global average level of carbon intensity of electricity 
generation. Other benefits include significant declines in emissions of key air pollutants such 
as fine particulates and sulphur dioxide.  
The rising share of variable renewables in power generation brings with it both challenges 
and opportunities. One challenge is the need for investment in storage and transmission to 
facilitate the deployment of renewables. In the STEPS, over 230 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of 
battery storage are added to the system by 2030 (Figure 8.32). The government is in the 
process of putting out tenders for new storage capacity. By 2030 in the STEPS, the 
transmission network expands by 35% with over 200 000 km of new transmission lines, 
including nearly 60 000 km of lines to facilitate the integration of renewables. India’s Green 
Energy Corridor project seeks to address some of this gap by facilitating the construction of 
transmission lines to support generation from renewable sources.

India faces challenges arising from the financial weakness of distribution companies, 
exemplified by delayed payments to generation companies totalling USD 7 billion in October 
2025. A range of reforms have been instituted including: establishment of a payment security 
mechanism; a payment security fund; and state government guarantees to increase investor 
confidence in renewable energy projects. These reforms along with other risk mitigation 
measures have helped double the share of foreign direct investment in total power sector 
investment to nearly 10% over its average between 2015 and 2020 (IEA, 2025e).

8.10 Japan and Korea 
8.10.1 Key energy trends 
GDP in Japan and Korea is set to grow by 0.8% per year to 2050 while the population in the 
region continues to contract by 0.6% per year over the period. Digitalisation, automation and 
high value‑added sectors, e.g. AI, robotics and semiconductors, underpin the economic 
outlook as governments double down on innovation, productivity gains, and industry 
transformation to offset labour shortages and sustain economic growth. 
Japan’s energy strategy, guided by the 7th Strategic Energy Plan, adopted in February 2025, 
outlines multiple pathways to achieve decarbonisation and energy security. A key shift is the 
explicit elevation of renewables to a mainstream power source to provide 40-50% of power 
generation by 2040, up from 24% in 2024. The Energy Plan also marks a turning point in 
nuclear policy: it positions nuclear power – alongside renewables – as indispensable for both 
energy security and effective decarbonisation. It envisages to increase in the share of nuclear 
power from 9% in 2024 to approximately 20% by 2040. However, uncertainties remain 
around reactor restarts, including that the timing of restarts will depend on safety reviews 
and facility upgrades, and public understanding. Delays could force reliance on alternative 
sources, complicating the decarbonisation and energy security path. 
Korea’s 11th Basic Plan for Power Supply and Demand, 2024-2038, seeks to balance rising 
demand with commitments to decarbonise while taking account of energy security 
considerations. The share of nuclear in power generation is set to expand from around 30% 
to 35% by 2038 as new reactors and small modular reactors are brought into service. The 
share of renewables in generation is expected to increase, and the shares of coal and LNG to 
decrease. By 2038, over 70% of generation is expected to come from low-emissions sources 
including nuclear, renewables and hydrogen/ammonia, with the twin aims of enhancing 
energy security and moving toward carbon neutrality. Uncertainties remain, but Korea is 
likely to maintain support for existing nuclear plant life extensions and small modular reactor 
development, though the pace of large new nuclear projects may slow. Its overall focus may 
increasingly shift toward renewables and next-generation technologies. 
Reflecting these strategies and policies, electricity demand in the region increases to about 
1 660 TWh in the STEPS and to just over 1 670 TWh in the CPS by 2040 from around 
1 460 TWh in 2024. In the STEPS, the transport sector is responsible for over 35% of 
electricity demand growth. In the CPS, demand growth is led by the buildings sector, which 
accounts for almost 50% of the total. One cause of demand growth in both scenarios is a 
rapid increase in electricity demand to serve data centres. Their electricity demand in Japan 
and Korea today is a little over 20 TWh and is supported by just over 5 GW of installed 
capacity. In the near term, electricity demand for data centres is projected to nearly double 
in both scenarios, contributing to about 20% of growth in electricity demand between 2024 
and 2030.

With policy support in both countries for low-emissions fuels and enhanced energy security, 
fossil fuel demand decreases between 2024 and 2040 at an annual average rate of 1.5% in 
the CPS and over 2% in the STEPS (Figure 8.33). Regional energy-related CO2 emissions have 
been decreasing since 2014 with minor fluctuations along the way, and this trend continues 
in both scenarios. In 2040, energy-related CO2 emissions in the region are over 30% lower 
than today in the CPS, and 40% lower in the STEPS.

Stable transitions reflect continued progress toward cleaner energy systems  
while maintaining reliable supply amid electricity demand growth 
Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; bcm = billion cubic metres; GW = gigawatts. 
Natural gas plays an important role in both scenarios as a dispatchable energy source, but 
both see a gradual reduction in its use after 2030. Renewables capacity increases less rapidly 
in the CPS than in the STEPS, which means that demand for gas stays higher. Natural gas 
demand currently stands at around 150 bcm. In the CPS, this is projected to increase until 
the early 2030s before returning to around today’s level in 2040. In the STEPS, natural gas 
demand declines by 10% by 2040 from the current level. 
Both countries attach significant importance to boosting renewables as they seek to make 
progress towards the goal of achieving net zero emissions. Renewables capacity increases in 
both scenarios, though at different rates. In the CPS, it is projected to increase by about 
1.5 times by 2040; in the STEPS, it almost doubles to 420 GW thanks to additional policy 
support and more rapid technology development.

8.10.2 Energy security in a shifting geopolitical landscape  
Fossil fuels accounted for 80% of total energy demand in Japan and Korea in 2024, almost all 
of which was imported. These fossil fuel imports travel through critical chokepoints: 
approximately 70% of crude oil imports through the Strait of Hormuz; 85% through the Strait 
of Malacca; and over 70% of LNG imports through the South China Sea. Price levels for spot 
LNG have been very volatile in recent years, reaching an average of USD 34 per million British 
thermal units (MBtu) and peaking at USD 85/MBtu in 2022 as prices rose for a prolonged 
period during the energy crisis experienced that year. In 2024 the price fell to an average of 
USD 12/MBtu, but the geopolitically driven price swings in 2022 prompted Japan and Korea 
to boost investment in regional energy sources, expand strategic reserves, and seek to build 
diversified supply chains through new policies and corporate commitments (Table 8.2). In 
parallel, both governments introduced emergency fiscal measures to cushion short-term 
price shocks; Japan has spent over JPY 10 trillion (USD 67 billion considering the 2024 annual 
average exchange rate) since 2022 on subsidies for gasoline, electricity and gas consumption.

Critical minerals 
diversification 
• Approved battery minerals and uranium projects under the Economic Security 
Promotion Act, including nickel mining project in Australia (Japan). 
• Reintroduced the investment tax credit system for overseas resource 
development and established the Supply Chain Stabilisation Fund (Korea). 
Japan and Korea have been pursuing various measures to boost investor confidence in stable, 
low-emissions technologies to support decarbonisation, energy security and affordability. 
Nuclear power is one such technology. It is being promoted by the two countries as a 
dispatchable, low-carbon source which complements variable renewables and can help 
achieve decarbonisation goals, enhance energy self-sufficiency and reduce fossil fuel import 
bills. Today, nuclear generates 280 TWh of electricity in the region, which is close to the 
combined generation of other major low-emissions sources including solar PV, hydro, 
bioenergy and wind (Figure 8.34). In both scenarios, nuclear remains the largest source of 
low-emissions electricity in the region, reaching almost 500 TWh in 2040. In Japan, the
