Foreword 
This latest edition of the International Energy Agency (IEA) flagship publication, the World 
Energy Outlook (WEO), comes at a time when energy is increasingly at the centre of political 
and geopolitical tensions. Of course, the links between energy and politics have always been 
close, but when we look at the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when 
energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once. 
Governments are contending with a formidable array of potential threats, vulnerabilities, 
dependencies and uncertainties spanning areas such as oil, natural gas, electricity, energy 
infrastructure, critical minerals, technology supply chains, data centres and AI, and more. 
Energy security today is truly a matter of economic and national security – and safeguarding 
it requires the same spirit of cooperation and focus that governments showed when the IEA 
was created after the 1973 oil shock. 
Take, for example, critical minerals, which are a major theme of this WEO but also reflect the 
broader role of the IEA on issues of energy security, where we move quickly to identify and 
address emerging vulnerabilities. 
The IEA was the first to highlight the risks of high concentration of critical mineral supplies, 
especially in refining and processing. Today, a single country is the leading refiner for 19 out 
of 20 energy-related strategic minerals. As we pointed out in our landmark report on the 
subject in 2021, reliance on a small number of suppliers raises the risks of supply disruptions 
or economic coercion.  
Over the past few years, the IEA has invested heavily in building up our global data and 
analytical capabilities in critical minerals, mirroring the world-leading capacities that we have 
across other parts of the energy sector, and setting up a Critical Minerals Security 
Programme. The topic was also a major focus at our Summit on the Future of Energy Security, 
held in London partnership with the UK government in April 2025. 
Today, the risks that we identified in 2021 are no longer a theoretical concern; they have 
become a hard reality. The implications spread across different energy technologies but also 
apply to other strategic sectors such as energy, automotive, AI and defence. They affect 
millions of jobs. As we highlight again in this Outlook, urgent action is needed both in the 
near term to strengthen preparedness against potential disruptions, and over the longer 
term to diversify supply chains and reduce structural risks. All of this shows how the IEA’s 
analysis transfers across into real-world impact. 
There are many other aspects of this Outlook that also have real operational implications for 
energy policymakers. The focus on electricity security; the countries like India, Indonesia and 
Brazil that are increasingly shaping energy market trends; the sea change in gas markets that 
is on the horizon with the new wave of liquefied natural gas (LNG), led by the United States. 
We also highlight, once again, two critical areas where the world is clearly falling short: 
universal energy access and climate change. Both of these have been longstanding focus 
areas for the IEA and the WEO for decades. We present a new pathway in this year’s WEO

for enabling everyone around the world to benefit from the advantages of electricity 
connections and modern cooking stoves – advantages that many of us take for granted. This 
builds on the momentum created by the landmark Summit on Clean Cooking Africa that the 
IEA and our partners organised in Paris in May 2024. 
And we highlight once again that, far from limiting global warming to 1.5 °C or well below 
2 °C, we are currently heading towards outcomes in the range of 2.5-3 °C, with severe 
implications for lives and livelihoods around the world. There are still pathways that mitigate 
these risks significantly, while the options to reduce emissions substantially are well 
understood and, in many cases, cost effective.  
I would like to warmly thank the team of IEA colleagues who worked extremely hard on this 
new WEO under the outstanding leadership of my colleagues Laura Cozzi and Tim Gould. 
More than ever, the world needs clear data and analysis to help navigate a complex and 
dangerous world. The WEO has always fulfilled that vital role and I am very glad and proud 
that it remains in that role today.

Executive Summary 
In a volatile world, energy security takes centre stage 
Pressing threats and longer term hazards are elevating energy to a core issue of economic 
and national security. Energy is at the heart of today’s geopolitical tensions, with traditional 
risks to fuel supply now accompanied by restrictions affecting supplies of critical minerals. 
The electricity sector – so essential to modern economies – is also increasingly vulnerable to 
cyber, operational and weather-related hazards. Decisions taken by energy policy makers 
will be crucial to address these risks, but they do so against a complex backdrop: 
 
Geopolitical fragility coexists with subdued oil prices. Ongoing conflicts and instability 
sit alongside oil market balances showing a large surplus of supply over demand. 
 
Countries are prioritising energy security and affordability but are reaching for 
different levers to achieve them. Some, including many fuel-importing countries, lean 
towards renewables and efficiency as solutions. Others focus more on ensuring ample 
supplies of traditional fuels. 
 
There are fractures in the international system and uncertainties over the outlook for 
trade, but energy trade is more important than ever. Abundant supplies of oil, solar 
panels, batteries and, before long, liquefied natural gas (LNG) create strong incentives 
for producers to seek out international markets. 
 
There is less momentum than before behind national and international efforts to 
reduce emissions, yet climate risks are rising. 2024 was the hottest year on record and 
the first in which global temperatures exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius (°C) above pre-
industrial levels. 
At the same time, the world remains thirsty for energy. New technologies are entering the 
system at speed, and renewables set new records for deployment in 2024 for the 23rd 
consecutive year. Oil, natural gas and coal consumption, and nuclear output, all reached 
record highs as well. Driven mainly by China, since 2019 demand for coal has grown 50% 
faster than the next fastest growing fossil fuel, natural gas, a key reason why energy-related 
emissions have continued to grow.  
There is no single storyline about the future of energy, which is why the World Energy 
Outlook presents multiple scenarios, none of which is a forecast. The framework presented 
in this Outlook is based on the latest and most comprehensive data on policies, technologies 
and markets, together with rigorous modelling. This allows readers to explore the 
implications of different choices and pathways.  
Scenarios 
The World Energy Outlook 2025 (WEO-2025) has three main scenarios. Two of these set 
starting conditions and then examine where they lead – the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) 
and the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). A third, the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) 
Scenario, maps out a pathway to achieve specific energy and climate-related goals.  
 
The Current Policies Scenario considers a snapshot of policies and regulations that are 
already in place and offers a cautious perspective on the speed at which new energy 
technologies are deployed and integrated into the energy system.

 
The Stated Policies Scenario considers the application of a broader range of policies, 
including those that have been formally put forward but not yet adopted, as well as 
other official strategy documents that indicate the direction of travel. Barriers to the 
introduction of new technologies are lower than in the CPS, but the STEPS does not 
assume that aspirational targets are met.  
 
The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario takes a different approach, describing a 
pathway to reduce global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to net zero by 
2050, while recognising that each country will have its own route.  
An additional normative scenario, the Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services 
Scenario (ACCESS), provides a new roadmap to achieve universal access to electricity and 
clean cooking – crucial development goals that the IEA has actively supported for more than 
two decades. The WEO-2025 does not include the Announced Pledges Scenario, which 
models a future for the energy system in which key national energy and climate targets, such 
as countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs), are achieved in full and on time. 
Our assessment of the new round of NDCs that were due this year, generally covering the 
period to 2035, will follow once there is a more complete picture of these commitments. 
What do the WEO scenarios allow us to assert with confidence about the future? Our 
scenarios cover a wide range of trajectories, highlighting different opportunities and 
vulnerabilities, but there are common elements. Most fundamentally, as economies expand 
and populations and incomes grow, each scenario sees the world’s need for energy services 
increase with demand rising for mobility; for heating, cooling, lighting and other household 
and industrial uses; and increasingly for data and artificial intelligence (AI)-related services. 
Beyond this, four other commonalities stand out: the changing nature of energy security, 
with the supply of critical minerals as an acute vulnerability; the arrival of the Age of 
Electricity; a shift in the centre of gravity of the energy system towards India and other 
emerging economies beyond China; and a rising role for renewables, accompanied by the 
comeback of nuclear energy. 
Serious threats are hanging over critical minerals supply chains 
Traditional hazards affecting the security of oil and gas supply are now accompanied by 
vulnerabilities in other areas, most visibly in critical minerals supply chains. These new 
dimensions to energy security have been a consistent focus for the International Energy 
Agency. They were central to our Summit on the Future of Energy Security in London in 2025 
and have been underscored by China’s new export controls on rare earth elements and 
battery components and technologies. The key risk for critical minerals is high levels of 
market concentration. A single country is the dominant refiner for 19 out of 20 energy-
related strategic minerals, with an average market share of around 70%. The minerals in 
question are vital for power grids, batteries and electric vehicles (EVs), but they also play a 
crucial role in AI chips, jet engines, defence systems and other strategic industries. As of 
November 2025, more than half of these strategic minerals are subject to some form of 
export controls. 
Fostering more diverse and resilient supply chains for critical minerals will take a concerted 
policy effort; market forces alone will not deliver. Since 2020, most of the growth in refined

production of key energy minerals came from the leading suppliers. As a result, geographic 
concentration in refining increased for nearly all key energy minerals, and particularly for 
nickel and cobalt. Our analysis of announced projects suggests that reversing this process is 
set to be slow. In the CPS, supply concentration would be likely to remain higher than in the 
STEPS, as weaker minerals demand translates into lower prices that favour incumbent 
producers with lower costs. Determined action is required today to enhance preparedness 
against potential disruptions, and over the longer term to build up new partnerships and 
projects that diversify supply chains more quickly. 
Resilience is key in a world of growing security risks 
There is also an urgent need to build greater resilience to rising weather-related risks, 
cyberattacks and other malicious activity targeting critical infrastructure. A new IEA dataset 
shows that recent annual operational disruptions to critical energy infrastructure affected 
energy supplies to more than 200 million households around the world. Droughts constrain 
output from hydropower and some thermal generators, while storms, floods and wildfires 
force shutdowns and damage different types of energy facilities, from solar plants to offshore 
oil and gas facilities. Power lines are particularly vulnerable: transmission and distribution 
grids were affected in about 85% of incidents. Weather-related risks are set to rise across 
our scenarios, which all exceed 1.5 °C warming on a regular basis by around 2030, diverging 
only after 2035. 
The Age of Electricity is here 
Electricity is at the heart of modern economies and electricity demand grows much faster 
than overall energy use in all scenarios. It rises by around 40% to 2035 in both the CPS and 
the STEPS, and by more than 50% in the NZE Scenario. Demand growth comes in varying 
proportions from appliances and air conditioners, advanced manufacturing and other light 
industries, electric mobility, data centres and electrified heating. Investors are reacting to 
this trend: spending on electricity supply and end-use electrification already accounts for half 
of today’s global energy investment. Rising electricity use means that electricity prices are 
becoming a key reference point for consumers and policy makers. For the moment, 
electricity accounts for only 21% of total final consumption globally, but it is the key source 
of energy for sectors accounting for over 40% of the global economy and the main source of 
energy for most households. This underscores the importance of secure and affordable 
electricity supply, and the economic and social costs of blackouts such as those seen in 2025 
in Chile and the Iberian Peninsula. 
A pivotal issue for electricity security in the Age of Electricity is the speed at which new 
grids, storage and other sources of power system flexibility are put in place. For the 
moment, some of these elements are lagging. Investments in electricity generation have 
charged ahead by almost 70% since 2015 to reach USD 1 trillion per year, but annual grid 
spending has risen at less than half the pace to USD 400 billion. This increases congestion, 
delays the connection of new sources of electricity generation and demand, and pushes up 
electricity prices. Curtailment of wind and solar output is on the rise, as are incidences of 
negative pricing in wholesale markets, but slow permitting is holding back grid projects, as 
are tight markets for transformers and other components. Risks have been mitigated in part

by the rise of battery storage, where annual additions rose to more than 75 gigawatts (GW) 
in 2024, but batteries cannot provide all the answers – especially where seasonal flexibility 
needs rise alongside short-term ones.  
Rising incomes and temperatures underpin a surge in electricity use for air conditioning. 
Cooling is a rising source of electricity demand in all scenarios, led by emerging and 
developing economies, with important potential impacts on peak electricity demand. In the 
STEPS, for example, income-driven air conditioning use adds around 330 GW to global peak 
demand by 2035, and higher temperatures add another 170 GW. The efficiency of new air 
conditioners is a critical factor for managing future strains on power systems. In all markets, 
there are already much more efficient air conditioners available on the shelves, at no or 
modest additional cost, than the average models being bought today. 
Explosive growth in electricity demand for data centres and AI is concentrated in advanced 
economies and China. Investment in data centres is expected to reach USD 580 billion in 
2025. Those who say that “data is the new oil” will note that this surpasses the 
USD 540 billion being spent on global oil supply. A tripling of the amount of electricity 
consumed by data centres by 2035 represents less than 10% of total global electricity 
demand growth, but it is highly concentrated geographically. More than 85% of new data 
centre capacity additions over the next ten years are expected in the United States, China 
and the European Union – and many are located near existing data centre clusters, putting 
additional strain on congested grids. 
New players set the trends as demand for energy services continues to rise 
Energy market dynamics are increasingly shaped by a group of emerging economies, led by 
India and Southeast Asia and joined by countries in the Middle East, Latin America and 
Africa. Collectively, they take up the baton from China – which accounted for more than half 
of global oil and gas demand growth and 60% of electricity demand growth since 2010 – 
although no country comes close to replicating China’s energy trajectory on its own. This shift 
in the centre of gravity of the energy system is reflected in multiple indicators. For example, 
between 2000 and 2010, advanced economies accounted for half of the growth in the global 
car fleet; in the decade that followed, China alone did the same. Between today and 2035, 
half of the growth in the global car fleet comes from emerging and developing economies 
outside China. 
Mapping the new geography of demand onto the distribution of global energy resources 
reveals that, by 2035, 80% of energy consumption growth occurs in regions with high-
quality solar irradiation. This is a sharp contrast with the past decade when medium- to low-
solar regions drove half of the growth. This helps explain the swift uptake of solar 
technologies in our scenarios, as well as the rise in demand for cooling. Many of the new 
demand centres in Asia have some domestic coal resources and rely on imported oil and gas. 
The continued rise of renewable energy 
The pace varies, but renewables grow faster than any other major energy source in all 
scenarios, led by solar photovoltaics (PV). In the CPS, where they face stronger headwinds, 
renewables still meet the largest share of total energy demand growth, followed by natural

gas and oil, even though annual solar PV additions in the power sector stall at around today’s 
levels of 540 GW to 2035. In the STEPS, policy changes mean that the United States has 30% 
less renewables capacity installed in 2035 than in last year’s Outlook, but at the global level 
renewables continue their rapid expansion. A boom in solar deployment is accompanied by 
robust growth across wind, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal and other technologies, and 
by improvements in energy efficiency. China continues to be the largest market for 
renewables, accounting for 45-60% of global deployment over the next ten years across the 
scenarios, and remains the largest manufacturer of most renewable technologies. 
Ample production capacity of solar panels and batteries, much of it in China, keeps prices 
competitive, but also raises concerns in some markets. In 2024, there was sufficient 
manufacturing capacity to have produced more than twice as many solar PV modules as were 
actually deployed, and almost three-times as many battery cells. China’s exports of new 
energy technologies, including EVs, have grown to account for nearly 5% of its total goods 
exports, and Chinese companies have been investing in manufacturing facilities abroad in 
Indonesia, Morocco, Hungary, Brazil and elsewhere. While some countries, notably 
developing economies, see a major opportunity to access cost-competitive technologies, 
there are also concerns about China’s dominance of these new value chains. A key question 
is what happens to this surplus capacity in the context of trade barriers, demand-side 
uncertainties, substantial pressures on technology prices, and falling profit margins for some 
producers. 
Nuclear power is making a comeback 
Another common element across scenarios is the revival of fortunes for nuclear energy, 
with investment rising in both traditional large-scale plants and new designs, including 
small modular reactors (SMRs). More than 40 countries now include nuclear energy in their 
strategies and are taking steps to develop new projects. In addition to reactors that are 
restarting operation, notably in Japan, there are more than 70 GW of new capacity under 
construction, one of the highest levels in 30 years. Innovation, cost control and greater 
visibility on future cash flows is essential to diversify a sector that has been characterised by 
high market concentration, including for construction, uranium production and enrichment 
services. Technology companies are supporting the emergence of new business models, with 
agreements and expressions of interest for 30 GW of SMRs, mainly to power data centres. 
With these developments, after more than two decades of stagnation, global nuclear power 
capacity is set to increase by at least one-third to 2035. 
Diverging pathways for the energy mix 
Along with some commonalities, the scenarios diverge in the ways in which energy needs 
are met, reflected in differing outlooks for oil, natural gas and coal. In the CPS, demand for 
oil and natural gas continue to grow to 2050, although coal starts to fall back before the end 
of the current decade. In the STEPS, the peak in coal demand is accompanied by a flattening 
in oil use around 2030. However, in contrast to last year’s Outlook, gas demand continues 
growing into the 2030s, due mainly to changes in US policies and lower gas prices. In the 
NZE Scenario, much swifter deployment of a range of low-emissions technologies brings 
consequent declines in demand for all the fossil fuels. Although underlying demand for

energy services is similar across the scenarios, the amount of energy required to meet it 
varies significantly. In the CPS, the world’s energy demand rises by 90 exajoules (EJ) to 2035 
(a 15% increase from today). In the STEPS, it rises by around 50 EJ, or 8%. In an NZE world, it 
declines. These variations reflect differences in the energy mix and in the technical efficiency 
of appliances and equipment. More electrified and renewables-rich pathways also use less 
energy by avoiding waste heat from fuel combustion. 
Twists and turns for oil markets and EVs 
Oil markets look well supplied in the near term, thanks to a quintet of producers in the 
Americas – the United States, Canada, Guyana, Brazil and Argentina – and muted demand 
growth, but today’s downward pressures on prices do not last long in the CPS. Underlying 
declines in production from existing fields and continued growth in consumption run through 
today’s overhang of oil supply relatively quickly. Some 25 million barrels per day (mb/d) of 
new oil supply projects are needed to 2035 in this scenario to keep markets in balance, and 
oil prices rise from today’s levels to incentivise the additional upstream projects.  
EVs are set to account for more than 25% of new car sales globally in 2025 and battery 
costs have fallen dramatically, but the journey ahead for EV sales and oil demand could 
take several routes. In the STEPS, we have revised down EV growth projections in advanced 
economies compared with last year, notably in the United States. Nonetheless, the share of 
EVs in new car sales rises above 50% by 2035, and oil demand levels off around 2030 at 
102 mb/d before starting a slow decline. In the CPS, the share of EVs in total car sales 
plateaus after 2035 at around 40%, and petrochemical feedstocks, aviation and trucks 
underpin growth in oil demand out to 113 mb/d in 2050. The NZE Scenario sees much faster 
electrification of the vehicle fleet, with much stronger implications for oil use.  
LNG looking for accommodation  
Final investment decisions for new LNG projects have surged in 2025, adding to the 
expected wave in natural gas supply in coming years and promising lower international 
prices. Since Russia’s cut to pipeline deliveries to Europe, LNG has become the preferred way 
of trading gas over long distances, reshaping global gas trade and bolstering energy security. 
There is now an unprecedented 300 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new annual LNG export 
capacity scheduled to start operation by 2030, a 50% increase in available global LNG supply. 
Around half is being built in the United States, and a further 20% in Qatar, followed by Canada 
and others. 
Natural gas demand has been revised up in this year’s STEPS, but questions still linger 
about where all the new LNG will go. Europe and China, the main destination for new LNG 
supply over the past decade, are set to take some of the new volumes, but the upside 
potential is limited in the STEPS by continued momentum behind the deployment of 
renewables, nuclear energy in some countries, and efficiency policies. As a result, lower 
priced LNG flows to other parts of the world where affordability is a key consideration, 
notably India and other parts of South and Southeast Asia. The response in these price-
sensitive markets is significant but not enough to use all of the available LNG supply in the 
STEPS, resulting in a 65 bcm overhang in 2030. This could be cleared by further coal-to-gas

switching, but the prices needed to do so are difficult for LNG exporters to match. In the CPS, 
a slower pace of transitions sees more LNG going to China and Europe, fully absorbing the 
coming wave of LNG supply and keeping prices higher. In the NZE Scenario, a concerted focus 
on bringing down global emissions constrains the space for natural gas. In all scenarios, a 
downside risk to the uptake of natural gas and LNG is a failure by the industry to reduce 
methane leaks. 
The storyline for coal will be written in Asia 
More than for any other fuel, the dynamics in coal markets are determined by a handful of 
major emerging and developing economies, with China by far the most significant, 
followed by India, Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia. Around half of global 
coal demand is used for electricity generation in these economies, and the outlook for coal 
depends to a great extent on their needs for electricity, whether the current momentum 
behind renewables is sustained, and whether gas can be priced competitively enough to 
make inroads. In the STEPS, renewables capacity additions in emerging and developing 
economies average more than 600 GW per year to 2035. This is enough to put global coal 
demand into steady decline, a trend that is even more pronounced in the NZE Scenario. The 
CPS highlights what happens if grid integration challenges are high and solar and wind 
deployment stagnates. In this scenario, coal demand is higher and falls more slowly. 
Access to modern energy remains a core challenge, but there is a way forward 
Today, around 730 million people still live without electricity, and nearly 2 billion – one-
quarter of the global population – rely on cooking methods that are detrimental to human 
health. Countries such as India, Indonesia and China have shown how ambitious policies and 
large-scale programmes can transform the outlook, but less progress has been made 
elsewhere, notably in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. As things stand, the world is not on 
track to close this huge gap in the provision of modern energy. The new IEA ACCESS outlines 
a country-by-country pathway to universal access, reaching this milestone in 2035 for 
electricity and 2040 for clean cooking. It draws on lessons about what has worked best and 
the renewed momentum to tackle this longstanding issue, including the IEA 2024 Summit on 
Clean Cooking in Africa. More than half of the population without access to electricity or 
clean cooking lives in countries that recently upgraded policies or launched new initiatives in 
these areas. In our new scenario, LPG underpins most new clean cooking access, increasing 
its use to around 3.4 mb/d in residential cooking in 2040. At the same time, an average of 80 
million people gain access to electricity each year to 2035, with rapid parallel deployment of 
grids, mini-grids and stand-alone systems. 
Diverging futures for global emissions and climate change 
Annual global energy-related CO2 emissions reached a record 38 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2024 
and in the CPS they remain around this level, meaning that by 2050 they are some 10 Gt 
lower than when we last modelled this scenario in 2019; in the STEPS, emissions fall back 
below 30 Gt by mid-century. These trajectories point towards a temperature increase in the 
CPS of almost 3 °C in 2100, compared with a 2.5 °C outcome in the STEPS. In the updated 
NZE Scenario, continued high emissions in recent years and sluggish deployment in some

areas mean that emissions reductions to 2030 are slower than in previous editions. Reflecting 
these trends, overshoot of the 1.5 °C target is now inevitable. Peak warming in the NZE 
Scenario exceeds 1.5 °C for several decades, returning below 1.5 °C by 2100 thanks to a very 
rapid transformation of the energy sector and to widespread deployment of CO2 removal 
technologies that are currently unproven at large scale.  
A pathway that mitigates the most severe risks from climate change remains feasible and 
there is strong momentum behind key technologies, but – ten years on from the signature 
of the Paris Agreement – some formal country-level commitments have waned. The United 
States has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and the new round of NDCs announced to 
date in 2025 do little, in aggregate, to move the needle beyond the outcomes already 
projected in the STEPS. Total energy-related emissions from countries that have already 
submitted new NDCs, as of November 2025, were around 20 Gt in 2024. Full implementation 
of their NDCs would see their emissions fall to 15-17 Gt by 2035, a reduction of 11-25% – this 
is aligned with the outcomes in the STEPS. There are signs that some countries, notably 
China, are committing to NDCs that can comfortably be exceeded in practice. 
Options to reduce emissions substantially are well understood and, in many cases, cost 
effective. They include actions to boost the uptake of wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, 
nuclear power and other low-emissions technologies; to improve energy efficiency; to 
reduce methane emissions; to increase the electrification of end-uses; and to use sustainable 
fuels like low-emissions hydrogen or technologies like carbon capture, utilisation and storage 
in cases where electrification is not practicable. The STEPS gets close to achieving the tripling 
in renewables capacity by 2030 targeted at COP28, with a rise to 2.6-times 2022 levels. 
However, the annual rate of efficiency improvement in this scenario, at 2%, is a long way 
from the 4% target agreed as part of the UAE Consensus. Implementing these actions at scale 
would require an intensified international push to increase transition-related investment in 
emerging and developing economies, and much more practical efforts to ensure that these 
investments deliver tangible near-term social and economic benefits. 
Mapping out the key choices 
Urgent energy security challenges are front and centre for today’s energy policy makers, 
requiring the same spirit and focus that governments showed when they created the IEA 
after the 1973 oil shock. Their responses need to consider the synergies and trade-offs that 
can arise with other policy goals, on affordability, access, competitiveness and climate 
change. Policy makers are reaching different conclusions about the right balance to strike, 
the course of action that can best improve the lives of their citizens. Our scenarios do not 
aim to provide all the answers. But they illustrate the key decision points that lie ahead and, 
together, provide a framework for evidence-based, data-driven discussion over the way 
forward.

PART A 
CONTEXT AND KEY FINDINGS  
Part A of the World Energy Outlook gives an overview of some of 
the central findings from this year’s energy projections, frames 
them within a wider context, and describes the scenarios that 
underlie them. 
Chapter 1 sets out the key implications of different scenarios for 
demand, for the energy mix and for emissions. It also examines 
the effects of these scenarios on energy markets and energy 
security, and explores their implications for energy access and 
affordability. 
Chapter 2 examines trends in energy, economics and geopolitics 
that are shaping the global energy outlook. It also describes each 
of the scenarios, sets out the key assumptions that drive them, 
and explores some of the most important ways in which they 
differ.

Chapter 1 
Overview and key findings 
Ten questions on the future of energy 
• The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) present 
two views on how the energy system may evolve, building on different assumptions 
regarding today’s policies and technologies. Both scenarios see continued increases 
in energy demand to 2050, albeit at different speeds, with emerging market and 
developing economies driving the increase, led by India and Southeast Asia.  
• Differences in the pace at which new technologies are brought into the energy system 
are reflected in the trajectories for fossil fuels. In the CPS, oil and natural gas demand 
continue to grow to mid-century, although coal goes into decline before 2030. In the 
STEPS, coal use peaks earlier than in the CPS and oil demand flattens by the end of 
the decade, but natural gas demand continues to grow into the 2030s, as a wave of 
new liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports brings downward pressure on prices. 
• The emissions trajectory in the CPS is consistent with warming of almost 3 °C by 2100, 
whereas lower levels of emissions in the STEPS keep this to around 2.5 °C, slightly 
higher than the 2024 version of the STEPS. In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) 
Scenario, warming peaks around 2050 at about 1.65 °C and declines slowly after that, 
largely due to active measures to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The resilience of 
energy infrastructure in the face of extreme weather and other hazards is becoming 
more critical. 
• Electricity plays a growing role in meeting energy service demand in all scenarios, 
supplied with rising shares of generation from renewables. Peak electricity demand 
rises around 40% by 2035 in the STEPS, with similar trends in the other scenarios, 
largely due to increased demand for cooling. Data centres and AI account for less than 
10% of global growth in electricity demand, but this is a larger factor in the United 
States where a large share of new data centres are located. 
• Today, around 730 million people still live without electricity, and nearly 2 billion rely 
on polluting cooking methods. As things stand, the world is not on track to close this 
huge gap in the provision of modern energy. Our new analysis draws on lessons from 
countries that have achieved rapid progress and outlines a new pathway to universal 
access, reaching this milestone in 2035 for electricity and 2040 for clean cooking. 
• The nature of energy security is changing; traditional risks have not gone away but 
electricity and critical mineral security are rising as key priorities. Grids, storage, 
dispatchable generation, demand-side flexibility and close attention to the quality of 
grid operation are pivotal for electricity security. In critical minerals the key challenge 
is supply concentration, particularly in the refining sectors where a single country has 
an average market share of 70% in 19 out of 20 strategic energy-related minerals.

Introduction 
The last several years have been a period of extreme volatility and uncertainty, with the 
worst pandemic since the 1920s, the worst energy crisis since the 1970s, rapid technological 
change in and beyond the energy sector, increasingly visible effects of climate change, and 
increasingly complex geopolitics. Governments are responding in different ways to these 
challenges, but many are prioritising affordability, competitiveness and energy security. 
These are all goals which present both synergies and trade-offs with energy transitions.  
The scenarios included in the World Energy Outlook (WEO) provide a framework for 
evaluating the choices that energy decision makers face and the potential consequences of 
those choices for the global energy system. Change in such a complex system is driven by 
multiple factors: 
 
Macroeconomic and financial conditions like interest rates, inflation and the rate and 
structure of gross domestic product (GDP) growth affect energy demand, investment 
decisions and the relative attractiveness of different technologies. 
 
Energy policies shape the incentives faced by investors, energy companies and 
consumers. Policies profoundly influence outcomes, although they do not determine 
them. They can be overachieved, underachieved, repealed or strengthened. The extent 
to which they are successful depends on many things, including their legal form, their 
level of specificity, the incentives on offer, and the way they are implemented.  
 
Investor strategies and capital market incentives influence investment across the energy 
sector. For example, the availability of capital to support the early development of the 
shale sector in the United States was instrumental in shaping the supply trajectory, and 
the way the capital market has more recently encouraged greater capital discipline has 
had a similarly powerful effect.  
 
Innovation and technology progress occur in response to policies but also 
independently. Technologies can always surprise: artificial intelligence (AI) as a major 
driver of electricity demand was not on the radar several years ago. Innovations can spill 
over from one sector to another, as with semiconductor and solar photovoltaics (PV) 
manufacturing, or shale production and advanced geothermal.  
 
Non-energy policies, trade and geopolitical trends have important consequences for the 
energy sector. The energy shocks of the 1970s turbo-charged efforts to improve energy 
efficiency, led to the first national research and development programmes in 
technologies like solar PV, and accelerated the deployment of commercial nuclear 
power. In more recent times, sanctions, tariffs and stockholding strategies have all also 
influenced energy markets. 
 
Consumer preferences, biases and cultural trends influence the kinds of energy-
consuming equipment consumers buy and the ways in which they use them. Consumers 
are not pure cost-optimisers.

Capturing all this complexity is a daunting task for any forward-looking Outlook, but these 
factors all feature in the design and modelling of our scenarios. None of these scenarios are 
forecasts: instead, they provide a way to explore the drivers and implications of different 
pathways. As such, we hope they provide a valuable guide for policy makers, investors and 
companies as they navigate an uncertain future.  
This chapter explores the key findings of the WEO-2025 by considering ten key questions 
about the future:  
1. 
Two of the IEA scenarios, the Current Policies Scenario and the Stated Policies Scenario, 
are exploratory in that they work forwards from slightly different starting assumptions; 
what do these scenarios tell us about the direction that the energy world is heading? 
2. 
What are the implications of all the IEA scenarios for energy-related emissions and the 
rise in global average temperatures, and what does this imply for the discussions at 
COP30 in Belém, Brazil? 
3. 
Examining recent energy history can help to understand some distinctive aspects of the 
future: how are the drivers of global energy demand in the coming decades different 
from those in the past?  
4. 
Electricity prices are a sensitive topic for consumers and policy makers alike: what does 
the prospective Age of Electricity mean for energy affordability?  
5. 
Artificial intelligence will have implications for all parts of our economies and societies: 
how much difference will AI and our thirst for data make to the future of energy?  
6. 
After some difficult years during the pandemic and the global energy crisis, there is a 
growing effort to regain momentum on energy access: what more needs to be done to 
provide universal, affordable access to electricity and clean cooking?  
7. 
Export controls on rare earth elements in 2025 have highlighted the importance of these 
new dimensions to energy security: how are critical minerals and other emerging issues 
changing the energy security landscape? 
8. 
Investors and project developers, led by the United States, have continued to approve 
multiple new export projects for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2025: where will all this 
LNG go?  
9. 
As things stand, there is ample underutilised manufacturing capacity for many clean 
energy technologies, especially solar PV and batteries, and much of this is in China: will 
the world use it?  
10. Answers to many of the biggest questions about the future will depend on investment: 
what do our energy investment projections tell us about potential gaps and risks?

1.1 
Which way is the energy world heading?  
1.1.1 Electricity and emerging market and developing economies drive 
energy expansion 
The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) represent two 
distinct views on how the energy system may evolve, building on different assumptions 
regarding today’s policies and technologies (Box 1.1). However, in some respects they reveal 
similar outcomes. Both scenarios see continued increases in energy demand as a larger and 
richer global population demands more energy services. In the STEPS, total energy demand 
increases by around 55 exajoules (EJ) to 2035, an 8% increase over today’s level. In the CPS, 
it grows faster, rising by 90 EJ by the same year, or 14% (Figure 1.1). Energy service demand 
is broadly the same across the two scenarios: the rise in energy demand differs between 
them because of differences in the efficiency of technologies and fuels. Around 60% of the 
difference is due to increased use of fossil fuels in electricity generation and transport in the 
CPS, which leads to higher energy loss as waste heat. Stronger efficiency policies in the STEPS 
also limit energy demand growth relative to the CPS.

Note: EJ = exajoule; TWh = terawatt-hour. CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario.  
In both scenarios, emerging market and developing economies drive nearly all the increase 
in global energy demand. Energy demand in advanced economies remains below its 2007 
peak through to 2035 in both scenarios. Energy demand in emerging market and developing

economies rises by around 15% to 2035 in the STEPS and by 20% in the CPS. In the last 
decade, the People’s Republic of China (hereinafter China) accounted for more than half of 
the demand growth outside advanced economies. However, as China’s economy matures, 
both scenarios see a slowdown in its demand growth. India, Southeast Asia and other 
developing economies become the main drivers of the increase in global energy demand. 
Electricity plays an increasingly important role in the functioning of modern economies, 
powering advanced manufacturing, high value-added services, the digital economy and AI. 
In the last decade, electricity demand increased two-times faster than overall energy 
demand. Both the CPS and the STEPS project electricity demand reaching essentially the 
same level in 2035, around 37 800 terawatt-hours (TWh). This represents an increase of 40% 
from today’s level and an acceleration of the pace of growth compared to the past decade. 
The drivers behind this increase vary by scenario: the electrification of new end-uses such as 
transport and space heating proceeds more slowly in the CPS than in the STEPS, but this 
effect is offset by slower increases in energy efficiency in the CPS in high growth areas such 
as space cooling and data centres. 
A decade ago, renewables accounted for around one-fifth of electricity generation 
worldwide. That has now risen to about one-third, reflecting cost reductions in renewable 
energy technologies and policy support in many markets. The share of renewables in 
electricity generation increases in both scenarios. However, the speed of the increase in the 
CPS is slower than in the STEPS as grid integration challenges mount and policy support is 
not extended after stipulated end-dates. The STEPS, on the other hand, sees the share of 
renewables in total electricity generation continue to accelerate, and it reaches nearly 55% 
by 2035. Despite the growth of renewables in both scenarios, neither manages to lower 
energy-related emissions sufficiently to avoid severe risks from a changing climate 
(section 1.2).  
Box 1.1 ⊳ 
Two views on the outlook for the global energy system 
Multiple factors influence the evolution of the energy sector: macroeconomic trends; 
energy and other policies; technologies and markets; and consumer preferences. Policies 
are a critical differentiating factor in our two exploratory scenarios: the Current Policies 
Scenario (CPS) and the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). Yet, policies are generally only a 
partial guide to the direction of travel. They are sometimes imprecise, can have 
unintended consequences, and are subject to change. They can be met, exceeded or 
underachieved; they can also be repealed or strengthened. 
Neither scenario targets any particular outcome, and both are grounded in a detailed 
analysis of the latest policies, market trends and technology developments. The 
differences in outcomes between them can be traced to slightly different starting 
assumptions, which affect how they project the energy system evolving.

 
The Current Policies Scenario builds on a narrow reading of today’s policies, taking 
only those that are adopted in legislation and regulation. It offers a generally 
cautious perspective on the speed at which new energy technologies are deployed 
and integrated into the energy system. It tends to project slower growth in the 
adoption of new technologies in the energy system than seen in recent years, or 
than projected in the STEPS. Consequently, the CPS projects a somewhat bigger 
continuing role for traditional fuels. 
 
The Stated Policies Scenario builds on a broader reading of the policy landscape, 
taking account of those that have been formally tabled but not yet adopted as well 
as of other official strategy documents that indicate the desired direction of travel. 
It does not, however, assume that aspirational targets are met. It offers a more 
dynamic perspective on energy technology and market trends, and it projects a 
slightly more rapid introduction of new energy technologies than the CPS. 
1.1.2 Do we still see demand peaks for coal, oil and natural gas? 
Demand for the three fossil fuels follows contrasting trajectories in the STEPS and the CPS. 
In each case, one major factor helps to explain the difference (Figure 1.2).  
Most global coal demand, 55%, comes from electricity generation in emerging market and 
developing economies, largely China. The outlook for global coal demand accordingly 
depends to a great extent on whether the current momentum on renewables is sustained. 
In the STEPS, renewables capacity additions average 620 gigawatts (GW) per year to 2035 in 
emerging market and developing economies, compared with 515 GW in 2024. This is 
sufficient to put global coal demand into a decline this decade. In the CPS, less policy support 
and higher assumed grid integration challenges result in slower renewables growth than in 
the STEPS. As a result, coal demand is higher, peaks later and declines more slowly in the 
CPS. In both cases, however, global coal demand starts to fall before the end of this decade. 
Road transport accounts for around 45% of global oil demand. The future level of oil demand 
is shaped to a considerable extent by improvements in the efficiency of internal combustion 
engine (ICE) vehicles and the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs). In the STEPS, the share of EVs 
in total global car sales doubles to 2030 and rises above 50% by 2035. This puts road 
transport oil demand on a declining trajectory and leads to a peak in total oil demand around 
2030. In the CPS, the EV sales share broadly plateaus after 2035, and ICE vehicle fuel economy 
continues to improve broadly in line with historical trends (though in some advanced 
economies it does so a little more slowly than in the past). In 2035, total oil demand is 
5 million barrels per day (mb/d) higher in the CPS than in the STEPS, with 40% of this 
difference due to the slowdown in EV sales. In the CPS, the flatlining of the EV sales share 
after 2035 contributes to continued growth in oil demand into the 2030s and beyond.

EMDE = emerging market and developing economies; CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies 
Scenario.  
Natural gas use in electricity generation is one important determinant of the difference 
between the two scenarios. In the STEPS, renewables moderate the growth of natural gas-
fired power in major consuming regions, and lead to absolute declines in natural gas use in 
electricity generation in Europe and advanced economies in Asia. The net result is that global 
natural gas use for electricity generation increases by slightly less than 10% to 2035. In the 
CPS, renewables and other alternative sources of generation gain ground more slowly, and 
the use of natural gas for electricity rises by slightly more than 15%. The different trends in 
the two scenarios result in natural gas demand reaching a plateau around the middle of the 
2030s in the STEPS, but continuing to increase in the CPS. The plateau in gas demand in the 
STEPS occurs later and at a higher level in this year’s STEPS compared with last year. 
1.1.3 How do market balances play out in the different scenarios? 
The World Energy Outlook in 2024 (WEO-2024) noted that the turbulence caused by the 2022 
energy crisis appeared to be receding and that market balances were set to ease in major 
fuel, commodity and energy technology markets. How market balances play out differs in 
the scenarios. In the CPS, higher demand mops up any excess oil and LNG supply more 
quickly, leading in turn to significant pressures on supply investment and higher international 
fuel prices in the longer term. In the STEPS, the peak in oil demand and plateau in natural gas 
demand help to mitigate these pressures and damp down price rises.

The bulk of oil and gas investment is needed in these scenarios not to meet increases in 
demand but to offset declines in production from existing fields. In the CPS, some 25 mb/d 
of new oil projects need to be approved to keep markets balanced to 2035, compared with 
around 20 mb/d in the STEPS, and natural gas supply from new fields reaches 1 500 billion 
cubic metres (bcm) in 2035, compared with 1 200 bcm in the STEPS. Tighter market balances 
and stronger demand for supply mean that markets pull in higher cost producers, and this in 
turn pushes up prices. In the CPS, oil prices are around 10% higher than in the STEPS in 2035, 
and natural gas prices in major importing regions are around 30-40% higher. Moreover, while 
upstream oil and gas investment needs in the STEPS out to 2035 are broadly in line with the 
average level of spending in recent years, around USD 100 billion more than that average is 
needed every year in the CPS.  
Market balances for copper and lithium are stretched in both the STEPS and the CPS 
(section 1.7). Manufacturing capacity for low-emissions technologies such as solar PV, 
batteries and EVs is substantially in excess of demand in both scenarios, implying fierce 
competition and downward pressure on prices (section 1.9). In both scenarios, key steps of 
the value chain for both critical minerals and clean energy technologies continue to be 
dominated by a small number of countries.   
There is no global market for electricity, but similar underlying drivers shape individual 
markets. Both scenarios see a similar task ahead in terms of meeting rising peak demand and 
increasing needs for electricity sector flexibility. Peak electricity demand increases around 
40% by 2035 in the STEPS, and by slightly more than this in the CPS, with much of the growth 
coming from the increasing use of appliances such as air conditioners. The projected growth 
in both overall and peak electricity demand underlines how complex a task it is to boost 
electricity resilience and security, and at the same time how important it is to succeed in 
doing so.  
Box 1.2 ⊳ 
How does the 2025 STEPS differ from the 2024 version? 
The Stated Policies Scenario is updated annually to account for changes in policies, 
market dynamics and technological advancements. It is instructive to look at how the 
projections have evolved. Changes in assumptions since the World Energy Outlook-2024 
(WEO-2024) have had a material impact on the outlook for energy in this 2025 edition 
(Figure 1.3). Some of the largest changes since the WEO-2024 include: 
 
Evolving policy and market backdrop: The last year has seen major new policies 
emerge in 48 countries, most notably in the United States. For example, the 2025 
iteration of the STEPS projects 30% less renewables capacity installed in the United 
States in 2035 than the 2024 STEPS version, and 60% fewer EVs on the road in 2035. 
However, EV projections have been revised up in several other regions: for example, 
the 2025 STEPS sees around 20% more EVs on the road in emerging market and 
developing economies outside China in 2035 compared with the 2024 STEPS, 
reflecting recent strong sales growth.

 
Higher electricity generation growth: The 2025 STEPS projects over 44 000 TWh of 
electricity generation worldwide in 2035, which is around 4% more than in the 2024 
STEPS version. The outlook for electricity demand to serve data centres in the United 
States and elsewhere are higher than in the WEO-2024, and higher demand for air 
conditioning in the Middle East and North Africa also makes a large contribution to 
the overall increase in electricity demand in the 2025 STEPS. Emerging grid 
integration challenges in China and other major markets also help to explain the 
differences in the generation mix between the two editions of STEPS. Most of the 
upward revision in generation is coal-fired power in China. 
 
Increased natural gas consumption: The 2025 STEPS projects 350 bcm more natural 
gas consumption in 2035 compared with the 2024 STEPS version. Three-quarters of 
this is for electricity generation, mainly in the United States, Japan and the Middle 
East, and reflects higher electricity demand and slower progress in adding 
renewables to the generation mix than projected in the WEO-2024. There is also 
faster growth in the use of gas for transport, notably for compressed natural gas 
vehicles in China and LNG for shipping, and for industry in emerging market and 
developing economies.

What are the implications of the IEA scenarios for the 
global climate and for COP30? 
1.2.1 Outlook for emissions in the exploratory scenarios 
Notably, 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the first in which the temperature rise 
from pre-industrial levels exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius (°C).1 The last decade was also the 
hottest on record (WMO, 2025). As countries submit new national climate targets in 
accordance with the Paris Agreement, it is important to understand where we are headed 
and what pathways remain to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.  
Figure 1.4 ⊳ 
Energy-related CO2 emissions by region and scenario  
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Emissions from coal-fired power generation in emerging market and developing 
economies account for most of the difference between the two scenarios to 2035 
Note: Mt CO2 = million tonnes of carbon dioxide. CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies 
Scenario; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.  
Both our exploratory scenarios based on today’s conditions result in high emissions and high 
temperatures, although they differ in degree. In the CPS, energy-related emissions remain 
close to the 2024 level through to 2050 (Figure 1.4). Emissions from coal combustion decline 
marginally across the outlook, but this is offset by increases in emissions from oil and natural 
gas. Decreases in advanced economies and China are offset by increases in other emerging 
market and developing economies. In the STEPS, global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions peak in the next few years, decline modestly to 35.2 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2035, and 
 
1 This does not mean that the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 °C is missed, as this goal refers to average 
temperatures across several decades.

continue to fall slowly to 2050. Emissions fall in advanced economies from 11 Gt to 8.6 Gt by 
2035, and in China from 12.7 Gt to 10.5 Gt. Emissions in other emerging market and 
developing economies continue to rise to 2035.  
Higher emissions in the CPS from coal-fired electricity, particularly in China, are the main 
reason for the difference in emissions between the STEPS and the CPS. They account for 
1.7 Gt of the gap between them in 2035. Slower increases in efficiency and electrification in 
industry in the CPS account for a further 0.6 Gt of the difference, and lower EV sales and 
slower increases in the efficiency of ICE vehicles for another 0.3 Gt. 
1.2.2 Temperature outcomes in the scenarios 
The long-term global average rise in temperatures above pre-industrial levels was around 
1.4 °C in 2024 and since 1980 has been increasing by around 0.2 °C per decade. All scenarios 
exceed warming of 1.5 °C by around 2030, but differences in climate outcomes between the 
WEO scenarios begin to emerge after 2035.  
In the CPS, warming exceeds 2 °C around 2050, reaches 2.9 °C in 2100, and is set to keep 
rising from there (Figure 1.5).

The average temperature rise reaches 2.9 °C in 2100 in the CPS, 2.5 °C in the STEPS,

In the STEPS, lower levels of emissions produce outcomes that diverge somewhat from those 
in the CPS. Warming exceeds 2 °C by around 2060 and reaches around 2.5 °C by 2100. The 
2025 version of STEPS shows an increase in warming compared to its previous iterations.  
In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), warming peaks around 2050 at 
about 1.65 °C and declines slowly after that. This decline is due to active measures to remove 
CO2 from the atmosphere, reducing emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases, and the natural 
cooling of the earth system after net zero CO2 emissions are reached. By 2100, warming 
drops back to below 1.5 °C.  
Inherent uncertainties in how the earth system responds to future emissions and warming 
mean that higher temperature outcomes cannot be ruled out, highlighting the importance 
of limiting the risks of extreme outcomes. There is a 5% chance of warming above 4 °C in the 
CPS in 2100, for example. Whatever its level may be, future warming from current levels is 
inevitable in all our scenarios and carries with it risks, including the risk that crucial tipping 
points will be reached. Those risks become extreme at the upper end of the levels of warming 
possible in the STEPS and the CPS scenarios. 
1.2.3 A limited overshoot pathway to 1.5 °C has slipped out of reach, but 
avoiding the worst climate outcomes is still possible 
The IEA has presented its NZE Scenario every year since 2021. It translates the global goal of 
limiting warming to 1.5 °C into a global pathway for the energy sector. Each country will 
determine its own pathway: the aim of the NZE Scenario is not to prescribe the same path 
for all, but rather to show what a global pathway looks like.  
In each successive edition of the NZE Scenario, the near-term emissions reductions required 
to prevent warming substantially exceeding 1.5 °C has become more challenging. Actual 
emissions have risen year after year, and continued investment in high-emitting 
infrastructure has constrained the path ahead. To meet the near-term emissions benchmarks 
necessary to avoid substantially exceeding the 1.5 °C target, each successive edition of the 
NZE Scenario has featured more rapid near-term emissions reductions, stretching feasibility 
to its limits. 
This year, the short-term emissions trajectory in the NZE Scenario has been revised upward 
following in-depth sector-by-sector analysis of technology deployment. Compared with 
previous versions of the NZE Scenario, energy efficiency gains take place at a slower speed, 
the pace of electrification of some end-uses is less rapid, and the deployments of hydrogen 
and carbon capture, utilisation and storage in the near term proceed more slowly.  
As a result of higher near-term emissions, the NZE Scenario now results in a higher and longer 
overshoot of the 1.5 °C goal. It is now all but certain that 1.5 °C of warming will be exceeded 
within a decade or less, and that pathways that limit this overshoot of 1.5 °C to low levels 
have now slipped out of reach. The NZE Scenario reflects the emerging reality that any 
realistic pathway to stabilising warming below 1.5 °C in the long term will entail a high

overshoot of the 1.5 °C target in the coming years. Technologies to remove CO2 from the 
atmosphere are expensive and unproven at scale, and everything must therefore be done to 
limit reliance on them by reducing emissions as far and fast as possible. However, if warming 
is to be brought below 1.5 °C, immediate and rapid emissions reductions must be combined 
with strategies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere at scale in the decades to come.  
In the NZE Scenario, global emissions fall by over half by 2035 from their 2024 level and reach 
net zero by 2050. Annual CO2 removal using the technologies available reach 2.1 gigatonnes 
of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2) in 2050 and 3.8 Gt CO2 in 2100. In 2100, this would mean removing 
the equivalent of the current combined annual energy-related CO2 emissions of India and 
Indonesia from the atmosphere. 
1.2.4 What can be done to get on track? 
The world is clearly not on track to meet internationally agreed climate goals and is facing a 
challenging set of economic and geopolitical conditions. However, there is significant 
momentum behind many clean energy technologies, and the options to reduce emissions 
substantially in the near term are well understood and, in many cases, cost effective. 
Although the current round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) has seen 
reasonably high levels of participation, the scope for progress and the scale of domestic 
policy ambitions do not seem to have been captured in the updated NDCs in aggregate 
(Box 1.3).  
Box 1.3 ⊳ 
What are the implications of the NDCs that have been put forward? 
The Paris Agreement calls on countries to revise their Nationally Determined 
Contributions (NDCs) every five years, and stipulates that each revision should represent 
an increase in ambition. As of early November, countries representing around 55% of 
global energy-related emissions had submitted their new NDCs. In January 2025, the 
United States announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. The full impact of 
updated NDCs will be reflected in future analysis; a high-level assessment is shown here. 
Total energy-related CO2 emissions from countries with new NDCs were around 20 Gt in 
2024 (Figure 1.6). Full implementation of NDCs would see their emissions fall to 15-17 Gt 
by 2035, a reduction of 10-25% below current levels. This is in line with the STEPS and 
would mean emissions falling faster than envisaged in the CPS. In aggregate, however, 
the NDCs do not imply additional ambition beyond what is currently seen in the policies 
and market trends captured in the STEPS.  
This aggregate picture masks significant differences between countries. Some countries 
have submitted NDCs that appear less ambitious than they could be in light of current 
policy and market trends. For example, China’s NDC goal of reaching 3 350-3 600 GW of 
installed wind and solar capacity by 2035 implies an annual rate of capacity additions of 
160-180 GW per year. This compares to around 400 GW of additions in 2024, and the

goal is achieved before 2030 in the CPS and the STEPS. Other countries have put forward 
NDCs that imply a faster rate of emissions reductions than captured in the STEPS, 
indicating that they will need to introduce new policies to deliver on their NDC pledges.

ambition as first-round NDCs, and are in line with the trajectory in the STEPS

Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. The estimates aggregate selected countries 
with 2035 indicative targets announced at the United Nations Climate Summit on 24 September 2025 and 
the Nationally Determined Contributions submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) secretariat as of mid-October 2025. 
Several key actions are necessary to put the world on an energy system pathway more closely 
aligned with internationally agreed climate goals. They include actions to boost the uptake 
of renewables and other low-emissions technologies, to improve energy efficiency, to reduce 
methane emissions, to increase the electrification of end-uses, and to use sustainable fuels 
where electrification is not practicable (Figure 1.7). 
Renewables are already expanding strongly; new capacity of over 680 GW was added in 
2024. In the STEPS, the global installed capacity of renewables increases from around 
4 900 GW in 2024 to around 13 700 GW in 2035, an increase of 2.8-times. This is around 70% 
of the capacity increase required in the NZE Scenario by 2035, which sees the installed 
capacity of renewables reach 19 600 GW in 2035. Nuclear and low-emissions fuels also have 
a part to play, as do actions to improve grid flexibility and resilience in order to facilitate the 
integration of renewables. Installed nuclear capacity expands by 70% by 2035 in the 
NZE Scenario.

Scaling up low-emissions electricity generation, improving energy efficiency  
and reducing emissions of methane are critical actions to get back on track 
Notes: GW = gigawatt; EJ = exajoule; PPP = purchasing power parity; GJ = gigajoule; Mt = million tonnes. 
Sustainable fuels include liquid biofuels, biogases, low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels, 
including hydrogen produced and consumed onsite. 
There are various ways to improve the energy efficiency of the global economy. They include: 
switching to more efficient fuels such as electricity; increasing the efficiency of factories, 
houses and appliances; and delivering universal access to modern forms of energy. In the 
STEPS, efficiency increases by around 2% per year to 2035, meaning that the global economy 
produces more than one-quarter more output per unit of energy used than today. In the CPS, 
this rate of increase is slower. In the NZE Scenario, the rate of improvement doubles to 4% a 
year by 2030, and it stays at that level to 2035.  
The energy sector is responsible for methane emissions of around 4.4 gigatonnes of carbon-
dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2-eq). Major reductions in methane emissions can be achieved with 
well-known measures at low cost. In the NZE Scenario, methane emissions are reduced by 
80% from their 2024 level by 2035. The reductions in the STEPS and the CPS are around 20% 
and 5% respectively.   
Electricity currently accounts for around one-fifth of global energy consumption. Increasing 
the share of electricity in end-uses has a central part to play to reduce emissions from the 
end-use sectors. In the STEPS, electricity increases to around one-quarter of global energy 
consumption by 2035. Increased deployment of EVs, heat pumps and other electrical 
technologies push this share to around one-third by 2035 in the NZE Scenario. However, 
electricity alone cannot fully eliminate emissions from energy consumption. Sustainable 
fuels such as biofuels and hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels are also required. In the 
NZE Scenario, their use increases by more than four-times by 2035.

How are the drivers of future global energy demand 
different from those in the past?  
Between 2000 and 2010, global energy consumption rose at an average annual rate of 2.4%. 
Then the pace slowed, with growth in consumption falling to an average of 1.3% per year 
from 2010 to 2024. In the CPS, total final consumption continues to grow at the current rate 
up to 2035. In contrast, the STEPS sees a slowdown, with annual growth of 1%, while faster 
electrification and other efficiency gains in the NZE Scenario allow for an annual decline in 
energy consumption of around 1% up to 2035.  
1.3.1 Drivers of energy growth of the past are not the ones of tomorrow 
The factors driving global energy demand are shifting. Demographic factors, once a major 
influence, are waning as population growth slows and even reverses in many advanced 
economies, the Russian Federation (hereinafter Russia) and China (Figure 1.8). The global 
population is set to continue to grow, but the average annual increase of 80 million since 
2000 is projected to slow to 65 million per year up to 2035 and then to 50 million to 2050. 
Two-thirds of the world’s population already lives in countries with fertility rates that are 
below the replacement rate (UN DESA, 2025).

Growth in conventional energy demand drivers is set to slow significantly  
in the coming years, though cooling needs accelerates

consumption growth. Their contributions fell to 2% and 7% between 2010 and 2024, and are 
set to decline further through to 2050 as growth in these sub-sectors slows. Meanwhile, 
other industries such as plastics and manufacturing are rapidly expanding.  
In the transport sector, the locus of demand is also shifting. During the 2000s, advanced 
economies accounted for around half of the increase in the global stock of cars. In the 
following decade, China alone accounted for half. Between now and 2035, rising ownership 
rates lead to emerging market and developing economies other than China accounting for 
half of the increase in the stock of cars as advanced economies see car ownership reach a 
plateau.  
Energy demand patterns are also changing in the buildings sector.  Space cooling is 
increasingly a leading driver of demand as rising temperatures stimulate more use of air 
conditioning, especially in emerging market and developing economies where average 
incomes are steadily increasing (Figure 1.9). While appliances remain significant, the overall 
balance of energy consumption in buildings is clearly tilting towards emerging market and 
developing economies and end-uses, reflecting broader shifts in economic activity and 
climate trends.

main engine of global energy consumption growth as its industrial output and household 
consumption expanded at dizzying speed (Figure 1.10). For example, China accounted for 
more than half of oil and natural gas consumption growth from 2010 to 2024, and 60% of 
electricity demand growth. Now China is moving towards a less infrastructure and 
energy-intensive growth model. This shift is reflected in a peak in production in some 
energy-intensive industries, e.g. cement and steel, and the transition to more 
electricity-intensive sectors, such as clean technology manufacturing, along with more 
stringent efficiency measures and increasing uptake of EVs. It is putting China on a different 
energy path, in which electricity demand continues to rise rapidly but growth in fossil fuel 
consumption is much less pronounced. In both the CPS and the STEPS, emerging market and 
developing economies other than China take over as the primary drivers of energy 
consumption growth and see energy consumption increase across all sectors. India and 
Indonesia stand out, with annual increases in energy consumption of between 3% and 3.6% 
to 2035.

differ in how the energy services demand is met. Differences in the stringency of efficiency 
policies, in fuel mixes and in electrification underpin the variances in the outlook for total 
energy consumption. In the CPS, total energy consumption increases by 1.3% per year to 
2035, and by 1% in the STEPS. Electricity has always been essential to a wide range of 
activities, but the development of clean technologies in the STEPS boosts its attractiveness, 
and it meets more than two-thirds of consumption growth in the next decade. In the CPS, 
the pace of clean technologies deployment is slower, which means that a higher proportion 
of energy consumption comes from fossil fuels. In the NZE Scenario, global final consumption 
drops by 4 EJ a year on average over the next decade, with 75% of the decline in advanced 
economies. While electricity consumption grows by a similar amount as in other scenarios, 
in the NZE Scenario the consumption of fossil fuels drops by 8 EJ annually, led by oil.  
1.3.3 Clean technologies and emerging sectors redefine growth 
A range of clean energy technologies made rapid progress over the last decade, and 
particularly in recent years. Since 2020, global EV sales have surged, heat pump sales rose by 
more than 25%, and the technology readiness level of several industrial technologies, most 
notably industrial heat pumps, has advanced. In some regions, new desalination capacity 
shifted from thermal-based systems to fully electric ones. In parallel, structural changes in 
economies and the emergence of new demand drivers, such as AI and clean technology 
manufacturing, are pushing up energy consumption in specific industrial sub-sectors.

scenario, 2015-2035

End-uses that were marginal in the last decade account only for a small part of the growth

In the STEPS, such emerging uses and clean technologies account for around half of 
consumption increases in transport and one-third in buildings (Figure 1.11). Their share is 
lower in industry: existing technologies meet most of the energy consumption increase as 
financial and infrastructure barriers continue to hinder the deployment of industrial heat 
pumps and electrolytic hydrogen at scale. In the CPS, deployment of some of the new 
technologies is considerably slower, notably EVs and heat pumps. In contrast, the 
NZE Scenario places end-uses on a decarbonisation path where new clean energy 
technologies become the sole drivers of consumption growth within each sector.  
Box 1.4 ⊳ 
Demand grows where the sun shines over the next decade 
Many emerging market and developing economies outside China have excellent solar 
potential. They include India and a number of countries in Africa, the Middle East, 
Southeast Asia, and Central and South America. While regions with medium to low solar 
conditions accounted for half of energy consumption growth over the past decade, their 
share is projected to more than halve in the coming decade in the STEPS. By 2035, 80% 
of energy consumption growth occurs in regions with average irradiation above 
4.5 kilowatt-hours per square metre (kWh/m2) per day, and 35% of total consumption 
growth takes the form of demand for electricity (Figure 1.12).

Favourable solar conditions present both a demand challenge and a supply opportunity. 
In many regions, strong solar irradiation coincides with high daytime temperatures, 
driving up demand for air conditioning. In parts of the Middle East, India and Africa, 
cooling is not just a matter of comfort but a necessity for health and life. In these regions, 
cooling is a major contributor to electricity demand growth, accounting on average for 
20% of the total between now and 2035 (IEA, 2025a). At the same time, these conditions 
provide an opportunity to harness abundant solar resources that should translate into 
higher average capacity factors for solar PV than currently registered, and potentially 
lower average generation costs. In the STEPS, solar PV meets over half of the additional 
electricity demand projected by 2035 in the Middle East, India and Africa.  
1.4 What does the Age of Electricity mean for affordability?  
Electricity bills are rising up the political agenda in many parts of the world as households 
and businesses grapple with higher costs. In the emerging Age of Electricity – where reliable 
electricity is increasingly central to modern daily life – the price of electricity is becoming a 
defining indicator of energy affordability. This shift underscores a growing tension: while 
electrification offers long-term efficiency gains and emissions reductions, it also increases 
the sensitivity of movements in electricity prices, which are shaped by a complex mix of fuel 
costs, infrastructure investment, market design and policy choices. 
1.4.1 Household electricity demand  
The Age of Electricity is reshaping household energy consumption patterns worldwide. As 
electrification expands across sectors, electricity is becoming a more prominent component 
of total household energy demand. Globally, average household electricity consumption is 
projected to rise 25% by 2035 and 60% by 2050 in the STEPS, though regional trends vary 
(Figure 1.13). This reflects not only the continued use of air conditioners and appliances, such 
as dishwashers and washing machines, but also the increasing adoption of EVs and electric 
heating systems. In most cases, these new uses of electricity displace natural gas and oil. 
Electrification proceeds more slowly in the CPS, while more rapid deployment of EVs and 
heat pumps in the NZE Scenario push it forward faster than in the STEPS or the CPS. 
In advanced economies, household electricity demand is projected to reverse a decade-long 
trend of stagnation. In the STEPS, it increases about 15% by 2035 and close to 35% by 2050. 
While increases in energy efficiency moderate consumption for appliances, the 
electrification of transport is a major driver of expanding electricity use in regions with 
supportive policy frameworks and increasing EV sales shares. This shift underscores the need 
for grid readiness and demand flexibility solutions like smart charging to manage peak 
demand and to improve affordability. 
In emerging market and developing economies excluding China, household electricity 
demand is poised to accelerate significantly, rising 30% by 2035 and 90% by 2050. The

primary reason is the increasing use of air conditioning as higher incomes and temperatures 
boost demand for space cooling. In China, home charging of the rapidly expanding number 
of EVs is also contributing to higher household electricity consumption. As electrification 
deepens, ensuring reliable and affordable access to electricity will be critical – not only to 
meet more demand, but also to support broader development and sustainability goals.

regions in the STEPS, 2024-2035

EV charging considers the total charging needs of all electric passenger light-duty vehicles irrespective of 
whether they are charged at home, at work or at public chargers. Other includes water heating, cooking and 
lighting. 
1.4.2 Pressures on electricity prices 
Rapid growth in electricity demand brings with it a need for substantial investment across 
the power sector. Grid infrastructure, in particular, is seeing a marked increase in capital 
spending to connect new loads, integrate new sources of electricity and enhance resilience. 
While rising investment does not necessarily translate into higher average system costs – 
especially if demand rises in parallel – the financing conditions and timing of the investment 
are critical. Power generation capacity is also expanding, with renewables leading the way. 
New coal- and gas-fired capacity is coming online alongside renewables to meet demand 
growth and strengthen system security, but these fossil fuel plants are likely to be called 
upon to operate less frequently as time goes by. Battery storage is expanding rapidly to 
support the integration of variable renewables, and contributing to a more capital-intensive 
cost structure for electricity overall (Figure 1.14).

The transformation of electricity systems entails a shift in cost structure, from fuel and 
operational expenses towards upfront investments in clean technologies and infrastructure 
Notes: MWh = megawatt-hour; MER = market exchange rate; O&M = operation and maintenance. CPS = 
Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. Grid- 
related costs include capital recovery costs for electricity transmission and distribution systems and grid 
operation and maintenance costs.  
Infrastructure is not the only factor exerting upward pressure on electricity prices. Carbon 
pricing, as embodied in mechanisms such as the emissions trading systems in the European 
Union and China, is raising costs for fossil fuel-based generation, although carbon taxes or 
carbon allowance auction revenues can be recycled to consumers. Tight supply chains are 
also having a visible impact across the energy sector, increasing the cost of equipment, 
labour and materials. Market design has a significant influence: if natural gas or oil-fired units 
continue to set prices most of the time even as their energy share falls, infra‑marginal rents 
for other generators may rise. While the price differentials that exist in this kind of market 
can incentivise the provision of additional flexibility, for example through the deployment of 
batteries or demand response, they risk straining affordability if driven by fuel price shocks 
or market power. Solutions include accelerating grid and interconnection projects, improving 
market oversight, and offering long‑term contracts or targeted support to protect 
consumers, while keeping price signals intact. 
At the same time, several forces help to moderate electricity prices. In many regions, natural 
gas prices are projected to decline over the coming decade as large volumes of LNG come on 
stream. Diversification of energy sources and a lower level of reliance on fossil fuels are 
reducing exposure to volatile fuel markets. As electricity demand rises, the fixed costs of new 
infrastructure can be spread across a larger volume of consumption, potentially reducing the

cost per megawatt-hour. In some cases, this dynamic may even lead to lower electricity 
prices in real terms despite rising investment levels, highlighting the importance of well-
designed policies and market frameworks that enable efficient investment recovery while 
protecting consumers. 
The factors influencing electricity price stability are also shifting. Reduced dependence on 
fossil fuels can provide insulation from market price shocks, as highlighted in Chapter 5. 
Increased reliance on weather-dependent renewables introduces a different kind of 
variability. However, analysis of seasonal patterns over the past 30 years shows that, while 
weather-related effects vary by region and can be significant, their impacts on electricity 
costs and prices are generally much smaller than the volatility related to fossil fuel price 
fluctuations. In many regions, short-term and seasonal flexibility needs are projected to rise 
substantially by 2050, but systems are increasingly able to manage these shifts through 
demand response, battery storage, interconnection and sector coupling (IEA, 2024). These 
findings suggest that while rising deployment of weather-dependent renewables bring new 
challenges, well-designed systems with enough flexibility can mitigate volatility and maintain 
price stability even where renewables become dominant.  
Climate change poses additional risks to electricity prices. Higher temperatures can reduce 
the availability of thermal and hydropower assets and impair the performance of grid 
infrastructure. At the same time, they may lead to higher demand, notably from cooling. This 
underlines the importance of grid investment: delays could pose risks to the stability of 
electricity prices, given that grid congestion can lead to higher wholesale market and retail 
electricity prices through the curtailment of renewables, the use of less efficient or more 
costly generators and reduced market competition. 
1.4.3 Household electricity bills 
Household electricity bills are projected to rise across most regions as electrification deepens 
and demand increases, though the scale varies. While increases are modest in advanced 
economies, they are more pronounced in emerging market and developing economies, 
where access and appliance ownership expand; they are especially large in China, where end-
uses electrify rapidly. The impact on total household energy bills depends to a large extent 
on the scenario. In the STEPS, and even more so in the CPS, higher electricity outlays are only 
partly offset in some regions by gradual declines in spending on natural gas and oil for heating 
and transport (Figure 1.15). As a result, while total energy bills fall in advanced economies, 
they rise modestly in emerging market and developing economies, including China. In the 
NZE Scenario, faster efficiency gains and a more rapid shift away from fossil fuels – through 
heat pumps and EVs – more than compensate for higher electricity spending, even when the 
effects of phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies are taken into account. Although this 
scenario requires higher upfront spending on new equipment and efficiency improvements, 
it leads to a clear decline in total household energy bills in advanced economies and to bills 
that are broadly in line with today’s in real terms in China and other emerging market and 
developing economies.
