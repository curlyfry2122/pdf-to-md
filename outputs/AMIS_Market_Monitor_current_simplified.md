Markets for wheat, maize, rice and soy-
beans remain well supplied as of November.
Global crop conditions remain generally fa-
vorable, though localized challenges persist.
Early-season drought is affecting winter wheat
sowing in China, the European Union, and
Ukraine, while excessive rains are hamper-
ing maize harvesting in China and the United
States. In addition, tropical storms in Viet Nam
and Thailand have damaged rice crops. De-
spite these disruptions, prices declined for
all major crops except soybeans, which saw
slight gains. Fertilizer prices also eased but
remain high relative to crop values, weighing
on fertilizer demand. The outlook is clouded
by the US government shutdown, which has
been disrupting the release of crucial market
reports, coupled with policy uncertainty and
evolving trade policies.
The Market Monitor is a product of the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS). It covers international markets for wheat, maize, rice
and soybeans, giving a synopsis of major market developments and the policy and other market drivers behind them. The analysis is a collective
assessment of the market situation and outlook by the ten international organizations and entities that form the AMIS Secretariat.

AMIS Market Monitor
No. 133 November 2025
Latest trends in export restrictions on staple crops
The OECD has tracked export restrictions on staple
crops (maize, rice, soybean and wheat) going back to
January 2007 as part of its contribution to the G20 Agri-
cultural Market Information System (AMIS) initiative. A
recent OECD paper based on the latest update of the
database highlights and analyses trends in export restric-
tions between January 2024 and June 2025.
The sharp decline coincided with the removal of several
pre-existing export restrictions by major market players
and relatively fewer introductions of export restrictions
overall. Notably, India removed its export prohibitions,
quotas, taxes, and minimum export prices (MEPs) on
rice, thus removing nearly all its rice-targeted export re-
strictions with the exception of its licensing requirements.
Argentina ended its export quota on maize and removed
its export tax on rice. Russian Federation removed its ex-
port taxes on rice and soybeans and ended its export
prohibition on wheat.
About 85 percent of new or continuing restrictions
from January 2024 to June 2025 were attributable to
four countries: Argentina, India, Russian Federation, and
Ukraine. During this period, rice was the most targeted
staple crop, accounting for 45 percent of export restric-
tions, followed by wheat (26 percent), maize (18 per-
cent), soybeans (10 percent). The most introduced type
of measure was export quotas (31 percent) followed by
MEPs (28 percent), export taxes (21 percent), export
prohibitions (10 percent), and licensing requirements (10
percent).
Even though export restrictions are often intended to be
temporary, the analysis shows that only a small propor-
tion (2 percent) of export restrictions introduced between
January 2024 and June 2025 lasted less than a month.
Around 44 percent lasted less than a year, 26 percent
lasted longer than a year and 30 percent did not have a
specified end date. Overall, export taxes tended to be im-
plemented for longer periods than export quotas, MEPs
and export prohibitions.
In a highly interdependent global agrifood system, export
restrictions on staple crops amplify uncertainty and can
heighten price pressures for import-dependent coun-
tries. Consistent monitoring of these measures is essen-
tial to reduce market volatility and enable timely policy
responses. The transparency provided by AMIS is vital
for the effective functioning of global markets and sup-
ports the resilience of agrifood systems, contributing to
ensuring access to affordable, nutritious food worldwide.

WHEAT Production in 2025 further revised upward to a new record
high, as updated estimates in Canada, the European Union,
Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine more than offset a
downward revision in the United Kingdom.
Utilization in 2025/26 slightly adjusted down from last month due to
lower feed use in the Russian Federation but remains above the
2024/25 level.
Trade in 2025/26 (July/June) changed little since October as upward
revisions to exports from the Russian Federation and Ukraine offset
downward revisions in Brazil and United Kingdom.
Stocks (ending in 2026) revised upwards on higher production estimates
in major producing countries.
MAIZE Production in 2025 scaled up further since October as
upward revisions in South Africa and Ukraine outweigh a projected
decline in the Russian Federation.
Utilization in 2025/26 revised only marginally month-on-month, yet
increasing compared to the previous year as robust supplies support
higher feed use.
Trade in 2025/26 (July/June) without major adjustments from last
month, but still marginally down on previous season.
Stocks (ending in 2026) revised upwards reflecting build-ups in South
Africa and Ukraine.
RICE Production in 2025/26 essentially unchanged
month-on-month, as slight upward revisions for Cambodia, Rep. of
Korea, and Sri Lanka offset downgrades namely for Mali and Viet Nam.
Utilization in 2025/26 upgraded somewhat, largely reflecting more
buoyant food use expectations for various African countries.
Trade in 2026 (January-December) raised, as higher anticipated
purchases by Viet Nam and Nigeria outweigh downgraded import
prospects for the Philippines. Nevertheless, trade in 2026 is still seen
easing by 1.1 percent y/y.
Stocks (2025/26 carry-out) marginally changed month-on-month and
seen reaching a fresh peak, underpinned by accumulations in the major
exporters, and in Bangladesh, Brazil and China.
SOYBEAN 2025/26 production raised marginally, with a higher
forecast for Brazil more than offsetting weaker prospects in India,
supporting tentative outlook of a record global output.
Utilization in 2025/26 generally stable, as expectations of higher
crushings mainly in China and Ukraine offset lower consumption in
Argentina and India.
Trade in 2025/26 (Oct/Sep) virtually unchanged month-on-month, up 1
percent from the previous season, with tentative forecasts largely
subject to the outcome of the China-US trade framework.
Stocks (2025/26 carry-out) scaled up month-on-month, mainly driven
by prospective stock replenishments in Brazil and China following
upward revisions of their carry-in stocks.
+i World Balances

Crop monitor
Crop conditions around the world
Crop conditions over the main growing areas for wheat, maize, rice, and soybean are based on a combination of national and
regional crop analyst inputs and earth observation data. Only crops that are in other-than-favourable conditions are
displayed on the map with their crop symbol.
Conditions at a glance
Wheat
In the southern hemisphere, harvesting is beginning un-
der favourable conditions. In the northern hemisphere, the
sowing of winter wheat is progressing with some areas of
concern in China, the EU, and Ukraine.
Maize
Harvesting is ongoing in the northern hemisphere under
contrasting conditions as sowing expands in the southern
hemisphere.
Rice
Global conditions are generally favourable, albeit with some
damage from tropical storms in northern Viet Nam.
Soybeans
Harvesting is advancing in the northern hemisphere as sow-
ing progresses in the southern hemisphere.
La Niña Advisory and Negative IOD
La Niña conditions are present and will likely continue into early
2026. There is a 71 percent chance of La Niña conditions during
November 2025 to January 2026, and a 56 percent chance dur-
ing December 2025 to February 2026, according to the CPC/IRI
Official ENSO Outlook. ENSO neutral conditions are likely there-
after.
La Niña typically raises the chances of below-average precip-
itation in eastern East Africa, central-southern Asia, southern
South America, the southern United States, northern Mexico,
and eastern East Asia. Above-average precipitation tends to be-
come more likely in Southeast Asia, Australia, Southern Africa,
and northern South America.
Ongoing negative Indian Ocean Dipole conditions are forecast
to continue during November (> 85 percent chances, according
to the IRI forecast). Associated with negative IOD conditions are
higher chances of below-average rainfall in eastern East Africa
and above-average rainfall in the Indo-Pacific region.
During November, above-average temperatures are forecast
across western, central, and eastern Asia, Europe, northern
Brazil, Somalia, North Africa, the Middle East, North America,
and southern South America.

Summaries by crop
Wheat
In the EU, sowing is underway, although delayed in parts of
southern Europe, especially in parts of Bulgaria and Romania,
due to heavy rainfall. In the Russian Federation, recent rains
in the southwest have improved winter wheat sowing and early
growth conditions; however, progress remains behind average.
In Ukraine, sowing is advancing as recent rains have mitigated
the long-term drought in southern and eastern regions. In Kaza-
khstan, spring wheat harvesting is nearly complete as sowing
of winter wheat begins. In China, sowing of winter wheat has
been delayed in the North China Plain due to heavy rainfall
and the delayed autumn crop harvesting. In the US, winter
wheat sowing continues under generally favourable conditions,
though dry weather affects the Pacific Northwest and eastern
Midwest. In Canada, winter wheat sowing is progressing. In
Australia, harvest has just started under mixed conditions due
to ongoing dryness in the southeast, while exceptional condi-
tions are present in Western Australia. In Argentina, harvest
is beginning in the northern regions, with most crops growing
under favourable conditions.
Maize
In China, the harvest of summer-planted crops advances as ex-
cessive rainfall causes delays and reduced yields in the Huang-
Huai-Hai region. In India, the Kharif crop (larger season) is
being harvested, with a noticeable increase in total sown area
compared to last year. In Indonesia, harvesting of dry-season
crops continues as the sowing of wet-season crops begins.
In the US, harvest is continuing with above-average yields ex-
pected in the northwestern Corn Belt, albeit with some delays
due to recent heavy rains. In Canada, harvest is wrapping up.
In Mexico, excessive rainfall and flooding have negatively im-
pacted the spring-summer crop season (larger season) in some
areas. In the EU, harvesting is ongoing under mostly favourable
conditions; however, yields in southeastern Europe are below-
average due to persistent drought. In Ukraine, harvesting is
continuing, albeit with reduced yields in the southern and east-
ern regions, due to the prolonged drought. In the Russian
Federation, harvesting is continuing under mixed conditions.
In Brazil, sowing of the spring-planted crop (smaller season)
is continuing under favorable conditions, and a significant in-
crease in total sown area is expected compared to last year. In
Argentina, the sowing of the early-planted crop (larger season)
is wrapping up.

+i Pie chart description
Each slice represents a country's share of total AMIS production (5-year average), with the main producing countries (95 percent of production) shown individually
and the remaining 5 percent grouped into the "Other AMIS Countries" category. Sections within each country are weighted by the sub-national production statistics
(5-year average) of the respective country and account for multiple cropping seasons (i.e. spring and winter wheat). The late vegetative to reproductive crop growth
stages are generally the most sensitive periods for crop development.

Rice
In China, the harvest of single-season rice (largest season)
and the late double-crop (medium season) progresses. In In-
dia, Kharif rice (larger season) is under favourable conditions
as harvesting progresses in the northern part of the country.
In Bangladesh, early harvesting of the Aman crop (medium
season) is beginning. In Indonesia, harvesting of dry-season
rice advances as the sowing of wet-season rice begins with the
start of rainfall in early October. In Viet Nam, tropical storms in
late September caused damage to summer-autumn rice (wet-
season) in the north. In the south, the harvest of the summer-
autumn rice (wet-season) is wrapping up as the harvest of
autumn-winter rice and seasonal rice (wet-season) begins. In
Thailand, wet-season rice is under generally favourable condi-
tions despite some recent flood damage from several tropical
storms (Bualoi and Matmo). In the Philippines, conditions are
favourable for wet-season rice, albeit with some losses from the
combined effects of the southwest monsoon and five tropical
cyclones. In Japan, harvesting is wrapping up under favourable
conditions. In Brazil, sowing is progressing with a total sown
area decrease expected compared to last year.
Soybeans
In the US, the harvest is progressing with average to above-
average yields, albeit with a reduction in total sown area com-
pared to last year. In Canada, harvest is finishing under gen-
erally favourable conditions except in Manitoba, where yields
were reduced due to dry weather during the key developmental
periods and then late-season heavy rain and flooding. In China,
harvesting is wrapping up under favourable conditions. In India,
harvest is nearing completion with the total sown area slightly
lower than last year due to excess rains earlier in the season,
especially in parts of Madhya Pradesh state. In Ukraine, har-
vesting is advancing with above-average yields in the western
region, while below-average yields in the southern and eastern
regions due to the long-term drought. In Brazil, sowing is just
started under favourable conditions, with an expected increase
in total sown area compared to last year.

AMIS Market Monitor
No. 133 November 2025
In October, the US federal government entered shutdown, In-
dia made new announcements concerning minimum prices
for grains and fertilizers, and Kazakhstan said it plans to ex-
tend its wheat export subsidies. The Russian Federation lifted
an import ban on Kazakh wheat; and the EU and Ukraine up-
dated their existing trade agreement. Ukraine set up a mech-
anism to exempt soybean producers from export duties, and
the Russian Federation extended export duties on sunflower
oil.
Highlights
Wheat
On 1 October, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs
(CCEA) of India approved an increase in all Minimum Sup-
port Prices for the 2026/27 rabi (winter sown) crops, includ-
ing for wheat to INR 2 585/100kg (USD 292/tonne), up from
INR 2 425/100kg (USD 274/tonne).
On 24 October, press reports indicated that the government
of Kazakhstan plans to allocate KZT 30 billion (USD 55.8
million) to subsidise transportation of wheat exports in 2026.
On 25 October, the Russian Federation lifted its wheat
import ban on Kazakhstan, with imports now allowed un-
der guarantees from Kazakhstan’s national plant quaran-
tine authority, according to press reports. The import ban
was initially imposed on 17 October 2024, then lifted on 22
April, before being reinstated the following day with some
amendments (See AMIS Market Monitor, November 2024,
May 2025).
Maize
On 3 October, the Russian Federation set duty-free quo-
tas for the export of maize from Primorsky territory and Amur
Oblast, through Order no. 1534. There are no existing maize
export quotas in other areas. The measures, which per-
mit the duty-free export of maize to countries outside the
Eurasian Economic Union, allow for 280 000 tonnes of maize
to be exported from Primorsky territory, and for 130 000
tonnes to be exported from Amur Oblast. It will be effective
until 31 December 2025.
On 28 October, the government of Mexico announced it
would guarantee a price of MXN 6050 (USD 329) per tonne
for white maize in the states of Guanajuato, Jalisco, and Mi-
choacán (supplying about 20 percent of domestic produc-
tion). The federal government will contribute MXN 700 (USD
38) in support per tonne, while another MXN 150 (USD 8.2)
per tonne will come from state support.
Rice
On 3 October, India lifted its ban on the export of de-
oiled rice bran, with immediate effect, through Notification
37/2025-26. The ban was initially imposed in July 2023 and
has since been extended (see AMIS Market Monitor February
2024, April 2024, and March 2025).
On 3 October, India amended its requirement for the inspec-
tion of rice exports to European countries, through Notifica-
tion 39/2025-26. A certificate of inspection is required for the
export of rice to EU member states, as well as to the UK, Ice-
land, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland; whereas for
remaining European countries, no certificate of inspection is
required for the period until 2 April 2026. Both basmati and
non-basmati rice exports are covered by the measure.
On 6 October, the Department of Agriculture in the Philip-
pines indicated it intended to extend its ban on rice importa-
tion until the year-end. The measure would then be lifted for
January 2026, before being reimposed from February until
April.
On 25 October, the President of the Philippines signed Ex-
ecutive Order no. 100, establishing a floor price mechanism
for unmilled rice. The Order specifies that the Department of
Agriculture will be responsible for determining and regularly
adjusting the floor price.
On 27 October, Bangladesh extended by one month the
deadline for shipping aromatic rice exports, following re-
quests from exporters, press reports indicated. The quota of
18 150 tonnes established in April has now been extended
until 31 October; while an additional quota of 5 800 tonnes
established in May must now be shipped by 30 November.
(See AMIS Market Monitor, May 2025).
Soybeans
On 3 October, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted
Resolution no. 1256, establishing the procedure that grants
agricultural producers and cooperatives an exemption from
the 10 percent export duty on soybeans and rapeseed, pro-
vided they can demonstrate that they grew the crops them-
selves. The law was enacted in July (See AMIS Market Mon-
itor, September 2025).
Biofuels
On 2 October, in the US, California authorized the sale of
E15 ethanol blends (increasing the allowable ethanol con-
tent from E10) through Assembly Bill No. 30. As a result, all
of the country's 50 states now legally permit the sale of E15,
although the timing of implementation and specific regulatory
details may vary among states.

Fertilizers
On 15 October, China suspended exports of certain types
of fertilizers, media reports indicated. Affected fertilizers were
due to include Technical Monoammonium Phosphate (TMP),
urea solution products, di-ammonium phosphate, and urea.
On 28 October, the cabinet of India approved the nutrient-
based subsidy rates for phosphatic and potassic fertilizers,
for the 2025-26 rabi season (winter sown crops). The sub-
sidy for phosphate fertilizers was raised to INR 47.96 (USD
0.54) per kg (from INR 43.60 [USD 0.49] per kg in the 2025
kharif season); and the subsidy for sulphur was increased to
INR 2.87 (USD 0.032) per kg (from INR 1.77 [USD 0.02] per
kg), whereas subsidy rates for nitrate and potash fertilizers
were kept unchanged. The tentative budget requirement for
the subsidy would be INR 379.5 billion (USD 4.3), the gov-
ernment indicated.
Vegetable oils
On 22 October, the Department of Food and Public Dis-
tribution in India notified an amendment to the Vegetable
Oil Products, Production, and Availability (Regulation) Order
2011 (VOPPA Order). Under the amended order, all edible oil
manufacturers, processors, blenders, re-packers, and other
edible oil supply chain stakeholders are required to register
and submit monthly production and stock returns through a
designated online portal.
On 23 October, the Russian Federation extended export
duties on sunflower oil, through Resolution no. 1640, until
31 August 2028. Duties are calculated as 70 percent of the
difference between the indicative and base export prices.
Across the board
On 1st October, the US government entered a shutdown af-
ter Congress failed to pass the budget. Investors are closely
monitoring the potential impacts on the global economy, in-
cluding delays in customs procedures, disruptions to ex-
ports, and reduced imports of raw materials.
On 3 October, India exempted, from any restrictions or pro-
hibitions, its exports to Bhutan of rice, wheat and meslin, and
various vegetable oils, through Notification 36/2025-26.
On 9 October, the Russian Federation allocated more than
RUB 877 million (USD 10.8 million) in additional funds to
compensate agricultural enterprises affected by the con-
sequences of the war in Ukraine in the Belgorod region,
through Order no. 2830-r.
On 9 October, the National Development and Reform Com-
mission in China announced grain import quota levels for
2026, through Announcement no. 5 of 2025. The import
quota will be maintained at the 2025 level, i.e. 9.64 million
tonnes for wheat (including wheat flour); 7.2 million tonnes
for maize (including maize flour); and 5.32 million tonnes for
rice.
On 14 October, the EU - Ukraine Association Committee in
Trade Configuration updated the trade chapter of the existing
agreement (Decision No 3/2025), according to which the EU
maintains duty-free access (within quotas) for Ukrainian ce-
reals, while Ukraine progressively lowers custom duties on
EU oilseeds and oils to near-zero by 2028. This new deci-
sion consolidates the tariff liberalization implemented during
the war and provides for a gradual reciprocal reduction of
Ukrainian import duties on EU agricultural inputs. It entered
into force on 29 October, 15 days after its adoption.
On 30 October, press reports indicated that the US and
China agreed to suspend port fees on each other’s vessels
for one year, pausing measures that took effect on 14 Oc-
tober. In addition, US officials said China had pledged to
resume large-scale purchases of US farm goods, including
12 million tonnes of soybeans this season and at least 25
million tonnes annually over the next three years.

Average*
Change
*Jan 2000=100, derived from daily export quotations
Wheat
Average GOI wheat sub-Index values were slightly weaker
month-on-month, reflecting mixed trends across major ex-
porters. Despite late-month gains amid optimism over easing
US-China trade tensions, values remained near five-year lows
on perceptions of ample global supplies. Strength in rowcrop
markets underpinned US prices, alongside steady export ac-
tivity and fresh reported deals with some Asian countries. EU
prices strengthened on sustained international and intra-EU
demand, though upside in dollar-based values was pared by
a weaker euro and stiff competition. In Russian Federation, a
firmer rouble, elevated logistical costs and new-crop sowing
delays offered price support. Conversely, large anticipated har-
vests weighed on values in Australia and Argentina.
Maize
Global maize export quotations averaged fractionally lower
month-on-month, albeit a firmer tone was noted across key
origins in the latter half of October. After an early dip, US quota-
tions posted notable gains on sustained export demand, high-
lighted by strong inspections data, and rallying soybean prices.
Speculation that US yields may fall short of earlier projections
also lent support. In Brazil, firmer US values, steady domestic
and export demand, and limited grower selling underpinned fob
prices. Quotations in Argentina also firmed, though trading was
subdued amid stiff competition and logistical constraints. De-
spite efforts to stay competitive, Ukrainian prices edged higher
on slow harvest progress, elevated drying costs, and conflict-
related logistical disruptions.
Rice
With little improvement in demand from key destinations, along-
side seasonal pressure in some Asian exporters, weak senti-
ment continued to prevail in the international rice market. Re-
flecting this trend, average rice quotations, as measured by the
GOI rice sub-Index, fell to the lowest level since 2017. In Thai-
land, traders lowered their offers in an effort to stimulate sales
ahead of main season crop arrivals. Indian white rice offers also
softened amid slack demand, albeit as sales to Bangladesh
provided some support to parboiled prices. New crop arrivals
pressured prices in Pakistan, while an ongoing import ban in
the Philippines continued to weigh on sentiment in Vietnam.
Soybeans
Average international soybean values, as tracked by the IGC
GOI sub-Index, firmed marginally during October as gains in
US Gulf values offset steady to weaker offers in South Amer-
ica. Despite pressure from the ongoing harvest, US quotations
strengthened on hopes for resumed purchases by China –
eventually confirmed after high-level talks in the latter half of the
month – as part of broader trade negotiations. In Brazil, where
competition between local processors and exporters was a
feature at times, average offers were little changed month-on-
month as an uplift in Chicago futures contrasted with a marked
erosion of fob premiums.

Maize and soybean futures markets showed a tenta-
tive recovery, though their upside remains limited by
prospects of ample global supplies and uncertainties
over US export competitiveness. Wheat markets con-
tinue to be anchored by strong global availability and in-
tense competition among exporters.
Expectations for near-term price volatility remain con-
tained across wheat, maize, and soybean futures.
The absence of official data on fund positioning has cre-
ated a transparency gap that is detrimental to market sta-
bility. However, available trading proxies do not currently
signal a buildup of speculative activity.
MONTHLY PRICE TREND
Overall market sentiment
Futures prices
Wheat futures prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(CME) rebounded in October, with the nearest-delivery con-
tract reaching a four-month high above USD 195 per tonne.
In contrast, Euronext milling wheat futures, near USD 220 per
tonne, remained steady. The CME rally was supported by re-
newed buying interest for US wheat from major international im-
porters, while demand for EU-origin wheat remained subdued
as less favourable Euro-to-US dollar exchange rate diminished
its price. Overall, the upside for global wheat futures is limited
by prospects of ample supplies and strong competition among
exporters.
CME maize futures also strengthened, driven by market con-
cerns over potentially lower U.S. yields following first harvest
results and spillover strenght from soybeans. However, price
gains were capped by the ongoing harvest in the United States
and favourable weather supporting a larger sowing of Brazil's
second (safrinha) maize crop.
CME soybean futures underwent a sharp rally, initially on hopes
and later on the confirmation of a new trade framework between
the United States and China. While the framework has already
led to announced purchases of US soybeans, its non-binding
nature and unspecified volume likely cap the rebound's poten-
tial.
The ongoing US government shutdown continues to cloud mar-
ket transparency. Traders are increasingly reliant on private data,
raising the risk of sharp price corrections when official USDA re-
ports resume, as was observed following the shutdown in 2019
Volumes & volatility
Price movements remained contained, with historical volatility
for CME maize and soybeans below 20 percent and declin-
ing through the month. However, a burst in implied volatility—a
forward-looking measure of expected price swings—for maize
and soybeans reaching 30 percent reflects unease among mar-
ket participants. Nonetheless, implied volatility remains subdued
relative to historical standards.
Trading activity on the CME and Euronext showed signs of
revival in October, with traded volumes exceeding those in
September, but remaining below last year's level. The uptick
was most notable in open interest on the CME, particularly in
wheat, which reached a seven-year high, indicating a likely in-
crease in commercial hedging activity.
Forward curves
The forward curves for CME and Euronext wheat maintained
a neutral near-term outlook, continuing to exhibit a contango
structure where nearby contracts trade below deferred ones.
The CME maize curve showed a neutral-to-bullish shift, with
the December-July futures spread tightening. Tightening spread
reduces the incentive for storage and encourages more im-
mediate selling. A similar situation was observed in the soy-
bean November-July spread, reflecting expectations for rela-
tively higher, though not booming, US export engagements fol-
lowing the United States-China trade announcement.
Investment flows
The US government shutdown has halted the publication of the
CFTC’s Commitment of Traders (COT) report since 26 Septem-
ber 2025, reducing transparency of managed money activity.
Available proxies do not indicate a surge in speculative position-
ing, as such activity is typically marked by high volume relative to
open interest —a pattern not observed during October's price
reversals. On Euronext, investment funds only slightly reduced
their net-short position, indicating a persistently bearish view of
the wheat market.

Potash
Phosphate
Potash and phosphate
Fertilizer prices generally decreased in October compared to
the previous month. Elevated fertilizer costs relative to crop
prices continue to weigh on demand, particularly for phos-
phates. Nonetheless, import demand in India remains robust.
While October was relatively uneventful on fertilizer markets,
several sources of uncertainty remain, including evolving trade
policies and the availability of exports from China to bolster
global supplies.
Major market developments
Input prices. Fertilizer input prices showed mixed trends in
October. Natural gas prices remained largely stable in Eu-
rope amid moderate demand and adequate supply, while
they edged higher in the United States on strong export de-
mand. The outlook suggests sufficient supply heading into the
winter months. Conversely, ammonia prices continued to rise
on tight spot availability particularly West of Suez. Reduced
ammonia production in Trinidad, driven by the lack of reliable
natural gas supply and a prolonged shutdown at a major plant
in Saudi Arabia are likely to contribute to tight supply through
the end of the year.
Nitrogen prices. Urea and UAN prices were down in Octo-
ber as weak affordability continued to dampen demand. The
exception was India, driven by an ongoing urea tender. Sev-
eral factors influence the outlook for nitrogen fertilizer prices,
including uncertainty about trade policies and whether China
will maintain exports beyond current quotas. India remains the
key driver of global demand, and if the current tender does
not secure the desired volumes sought, a possible follow-up
tender could provide continued support for prices.
Phosphate. Weak phosphorus fertilizer affordability contin-
ued to weigh on demand, pushing prices lower in October.
Prices in both Brazil and India have declined over recent
months. The outlook points to persistently tight supply, partic-
ularly given the recently increased subsidies in India and the
expectation that China will limit exports. However, potential
demand destruction is likely to cap any price gains.
Potash. Potash prices remained largely stable in October
amid subdued buying activity. While low domestic inventories
in China could spur higher import demand, the global outlook
suggests minimal changes to current market dynamics. Im-
port contract negotiations may start in the coming weeks for
2026 deliveries to China and India.

Fertilizer crop price ratio for selected regions and
commodities
The AMIS fertilizer cost indices monitor the weekly development
of fertilizer expenses per hectare of specific crops. In October
2025, all crop – location indicators maintained the downward
trajectory observed in prior months. Despite the decline, fertilizer
costs remained above October 2024 levels in all regions except
China. In the EU (France), the average fertilizer cost index for
wheat closed the month of October 73 percent above the 2019
baseline—matching the level last recorded in June 2025, but
40 percent above the baseline in October 2024. In the United
States, the maize fertilizer cost index declined by an additional
three percentage points in October, settling at 74 percent above
the 2019 reference level, and continuing its steady decline from
the July 2025 peak of 96 percent. In Brazil, soybean fertilizer
costs fell by a further eight percentage points, reaching 52 per-
cent above the 2019 baseline, largely due to lower phosphate
prices. In China, the rice cost index stood at 13 percent above
the baseline, reflecting continued declines in nitrogen fertilizer
prices.
The AMIS fertilizer crop price ratio gauges the relative dynamics
of developments in fertilizer prices in comparison to crop prices.
In the EU and the US, current values indicate persistently lower
fertilizer affordability compered to pre-COVID levels. In Octo-
ber 2025, the nitrogen-to-wheat ratio in the European Union
(France) held at roughly 65 percent above the 2019 baseline,
as both wheat and nitrogen prices eased, until last days of the
month when nitrogen prices raised the ratio to 78 percent above
the baseline. In the United States, the urea-to-maize price ratio
closed the month at 37 percent above the baseline, still notably
higher than the 8 percent recorded in October 2024. In con-
trast, fertilizer affordability remains relatively better than in 2019
in Brazil and China. In Brazil, potash has remained consistently
affordable relative to soybean prices, with the ratio stable at 86
percent of the 2019 baseline. In China, urea affordability for rice
production improved further, with the ratio standing at 91 per-
cent of the baseline, as domestic urea prices declined further.
Fertilizer market developments - Selected leading crop producers
Brazil: Fertilizer prices declined in October, with market activ-
ity largely limited to spot transactions for the coffee and orange
sectors. Import demand for phosphates remained subdued, as
higher imports of superphosphates and NP fertilizers offset re-
duced MAP imports. Toward the end of 2025, nitrogen pur-
chases may increase due to returning demand; however, am-
ple ammonium sulfate imports are expected to curb demand for
other nitrogen fertilizers.
China: Domestic prices remained relatively firm, with a grad-
ual recovery in buying interest following weather-related delays
affecting autumn applications. Elevated phosphate production
costs and below average potash inventories supported prices.
Uncertainty persists regarding potential extensions of urea and
phosphate export allocations after the 15 October deadline.
EU: Farm-level purchasing remained subdued in October, con-
strained by affordability issues. Procurement is expected to ac-
celerate ahead of the CBAM implementation on 1 January 2026.
Further uncertainty arises from the EU’s launch of anti-dumping
investigations into urea imports from Russian Federation.
India: The 15 October tender for 2 million tonnes of urea dom-
inated global market discussions. Challenges in securing vol-
umes may prompt an additional tender to ensure fertilizer avail-
ability for the Rabi season (October-March). The nutrient-based
subsidy scheme has been announced, featuring a 10 percent
increase in phosphate subsidies for the Rabi period.
US: Nitrogen and phosphate prices declined in line with global
trends, while North American markets remained unusually quiet.
Harvest activities, the government shutdown limiting farm sup-
port payments, and reduced affordability have constrained buy-
ing. DAP/MAP imports dropped 30 percent during January–July
compared to the same period last year; renewed demand could
expose supply gaps.

Vegetable oil export prices
In October, international vegetable oil prices moved in differ-
ent directions. Palm oil quotations eased slightly on higher-
than-expected output in Southeast Asia, while rapeseed and
sunflower oil prices held firm, supported by tight market fun-
damentals. Soyoil remained the cheapest among major veg-
etable oils globally.
Highlights
Palm oil
Palm oil export prices eased slightly but retained their premium
over Argentine soybean oil values. The marginal decline was pri-
marily driven by higher-than-expected production in Southeast
Asia, while uncertainty surrounding the timing of the implemen-
tation of Indonesia’s planned increase in the biodiesel blending
mandate also weighed on palm oil prices.
Soybean oil
In October, global soyoil prices held steady and remained the
lowest among major vegetable oils. While strong domestic de-
mand in Brazil and the United States supported prices, uncer-
tainty over potential delays in finalizing biofuel mandates in the
US due to government shutdown exerted downward pressures.
Crush margins in Argentina and the US remained favourable,
with margins in Brazil and China also showing recovery.
Rapeseed oil
In October, international rapeseed oil prices continued their up-
ward trend, driven by prolonged tight supplies and anticipated
growth in biodiesel demand in the European Union.
Sunflower oil
International sunflower oil prices remained firm in October, sup-
ported primarily by lower-than-expected sunflower seed pro-
duction in the Black Sea region. Additionally, reserved farmer
selling in major producing countries and strong demand from
India and Türkiye provided further support to prices.
Biomass-based diesel
Amid still elevated D4 RIN prices, the D4 RIN generation in
September reached the highest level recorded in 2025, sig-
nalling increased feedstock consumption. However, ongoing
uncertainty surrounding US biofuel policy continues to cast
doubt on the feedstock market outlook.

Selected IGC GOFI sub-indices
Average Baltic Dry Index (BDI)
values declined by a
net 6 percent during October, yet were around 20 per-
cent higher than one year ago.
While average values across all underlying vessel seg-
ments were lower month-on-month, the period featured
increased market uncertainty linked to the introduction of
reciprocal port charges by the US and China, which, how-
ever, were suspended in late-October, following bilateral
negotiations.
Average Capesize vessel earnings fell by an average 8
percent over the month, as activity slowed during China’s
Golden Week Holidays in early October, with softer de-
mand on key minerals-carrying weighing more recently.
Panamax rates declined by 3 percent, on average, as
losses in the Atlantic, amid ample tonnage supply and lim-
ited fresh enquiries, were partly offset by brisk trade in the
Pacific. In the latter region, support came from sustained
demand for minerals and coal, as well as for transpacific
grains shipments from North America’s Pacific Northwest.
Lower earnings were also recorded in the Supramax
sector, the corresponding sub-Index averaging 5 percent
lower month-on-month. Losses at the US Gulf and in
Asia were partly countered by improved sentiment in other
loading areas.
In contrast, the Baltic Handysize Index (not included in
the Baltic Dry Index (BDI) ) firmed by an average 8 per-
cent, as steady demand and tightening vessel supply un-
derpinned rates in Europe and the Mediterranean.
The IGC Grains and Oilseeds Freight Index (GOFI),
which tracks total voyage costs on key grains and
oilseeds routes, declined by 2 percent month-on-month
on softer timecharter costs and marine fuel values. How-
ever, mild gains were noted on routes from Australia and
the EU.

Baltic Dry Index (BDI): A benchmark indicator issued daily by the Baltic Exchange, providing assessed costs of moving raw materials on ocean going vessels.
Comprises sub-Indices for three segments: Capesize, Panamax and Supramax. The Baltic Handysize Index excluded from the BDI from 1 March 2018. IGC
Grains and Oilseeds Freight Index (GOFI): A trade-weighted composite measure of ocean freight costs for grains and oilseeds, issued daily by the International
Grains Council. Includes sub-Indices for seven main origins (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Black Sea, Canada, the EU and the USA). Constructed based on nominal
HSS (heavy grains, soybeans, sorghum) voyage rates on selected major routes. Capesize: Vessels with deadweight tonnage (DWT) above 80,000 DWT, primarily
transporting coal, iron ore and other heavy raw materials on long-haul routes. Panamax: Carriers with capacity of 60,000-80,000 DWT, mostly geared to transporting
coal, grains, oilseeds and other bulks, including sugar and cement. Supramax/Handysize: Ships with capacity below 60,000 DWT, accounting for the majority of
the world's ocean-going vessels and able to transport a wide variety of cargos, including grains and oilseeds.

Explanatory note
The notions of tightening and easing used in the summary
table of "Markets at a glance" reflect judgmental views that
take into account market fundamentals, inter-alia price develop-
ments and short-term trends in demand and supply, especially
changes in stocks.
All totals (aggregates) are computed from unrounded data.
World supply and demand estimates/forecasts are based on
the latest data published by FAO, IGC and USDA. For the for-
mer, they also take into account information provided by AMIS
focal points (hence the notion "FAO-AMIS"). World estimates
and forecasts produced by the three sources may vary due
to several reasons, such as varying release dates and differ-
ent methodologies used in constructing commodity balances.
Specifically:
PRODUCTION: Wheat production data from all three sources
refer to production occurring in the first year of the marketing
season shown (e.g. crops harvested in 2016 are allocated to the
2016/17 marketing season). Maize and rice production data for
FAO-AMIS refer to crops harvested during the first year of the
marketing season (e.g. 2016 for the 2016/17 marketing sea-
son) in both the northern and southern hemisphere. Rice pro-
duction data for FAO-AMIS also include northern hemisphere
production from secondary crops harvested in the second year
of the marketing season (e.g. 2017 for the 2016/17 marketing
season). By contrast, rice and maize data for USDA and IGC
encompass production in the northern hemisphere occurring
during the first year of the season (e.g. 2016 for the 2016/17
marketing season), as well as crops harvested in the southern
hemisphere during the second year of the season (e.g. 2017
for the 2016/17 marketing season). For soybeans, the latter ap-
proach is used by all three sources.
SUPPLY: Defined as production plus opening stocks by all three
sources.
UTILIZATION: For all three sources, wheat, maize and rice uti-
lization includes food, feed and other uses (namely, seeds, in-
dustrial uses and post-harvest losses). For soybeans, it com-
prises crush, food and other uses. However, for all AMIS com-
modities, the use categories may be grouped differently across
sources and may also include residual values.
TRADE: Data refer to exports. For wheat and maize, trade is
reported on a July/June basis, except for USDA maize trade
estimates, which are reported on an October/September basis.
Wheat trade data from all three sources includes wheat flour in
wheat grain equivalent, while the USDA also considers wheat
products. For rice, trade covers shipments from January to De-
cember of the second year of the respective marketing season.
For soybeans, trade is reported on an October/September ba-
sis by FAO-AMIS and the IGC, while USDA data are based on
local marketing years except for Argentina and Brazil which are
reported on an October/September basis. Trade between Eu-
ropean Union member states is excluded.
STOCKS: In general, world stocks of AMIS crops refer to the
sum of carry-overs at the close of each country's national mar-
keting year. For soybeans, stock levels reported by the USDA
are based on local marketing years, except for Argentina and
Brazil, which are adjusted to October/September. For maize
and rice, global estimates may vary across sources because
of differences in the allocation of production in southern hemi-
sphere countries.
