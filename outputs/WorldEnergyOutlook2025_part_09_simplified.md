priority now is to restart existing reactors to increase the share of generation in addition to 
announcing plans to build new reactors. In Korea, the priority is to move ahead with two new 
reactors (Saeul 3 and 4) under construction. If nuclear power development is delayed and 
generation remains at current levels, more than 180 GW of additional solar PV capacity or 
almost 40 bcm of extra gas will be required in the region in 2040 to fill the gap.

Nuclear energy plays a central role to decarbonise the power sector,  
accounting for about 40% of low-emissions electricity in 2040  
Note: TWh = terawatt-hour. 
Circumstances in the two countries differ, but public leadership is essential in both to 
establish predictable licensing processes for the development of nuclear power, implement 
institutional reforms that improve profitability, and create financial instruments such as loan 
guarantees, green bonds or dedicated investment funds to mobilise private capital. At the 
same time, investing in workforce development and diversifying supply chains will 
strengthen resilience and competitiveness. Korea has a key strength in this area, supported 
by robust domestic and international nuclear projects. Equally important is a clear pathway 
for the safe and final disposal of nuclear waste, which is critical for both public trust and long-
term sustainability. In Japan, the legal process for selecting a site has been progressing 
steadily. By providing transparent roadmaps and addressing public concerns, policy makers 
can help to ensure nuclear energy remains a pillar of a low-emissions future. 
Electricity grids are another essential investment in energy security. It has been difficult for 
some system operators in Japan to advance transmission projects under the national Master 
Plan of Nationwide Power Transmission, including the largest project that costs JPY 3 trillion 
(USD 20 billion), but these are essential for secure operation of the power sector.

8.11 Southeast Asia 
8.11.1 Key energy trends 
Southeast Asia is one of the world’s fastest growing regions. Its GDP increased by nearly 5% 
year-on-year in 2024 and is expected to continue to increase by 4% per year on average 
through to 2035, boosted by its position as a global manufacturing hub. Total energy demand 
in Southeast Asia has increased by 40% since 2015 as its economy expanded. Some 97% of 
households now have access to electricity, and the region is on track to achieve full access 
by 2030. The surge in energy demand resulted in a doubling of coal consumption since 2015, 
mostly for power, while demand for oil and natural gas rose by more than 10%. Modern 
bioenergy has emerged as an important fuel, with its consumption doubling since 2015, 
second only to coal in terms of absolute growth since 2015. 
Figure 8.35 ⊳ Energy demand by source and total energy-related CO2 
emissions by scenario in Southeast Asia, 2015-2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Building on a 40% increase since 2015, total energy demand rises another third  
by 2035 in the STEPS; coal demand grows the most in absolute terms 
Note: EJ = exajoule; Gt CO2 = gigatonnes of carbon dioxide. 
In the STEPS, energy demand continues to rise rapidly, by nearly a third by 2035 (Figure 8.35). 
Coal sees the largest absolute increase, followed by natural gas and oil. Bioenergy demand 
slows, while solar PV and wind power meet an increasing share of demand. In the CPS, energy 
demand rises faster: coal and natural gas consumption increases by roughly a third to 2035, 
and oil and bioenergy consumption by about a quarter. Integration challenges associated 
with a less flexible generation mix and more constrained grids mean that solar PV and wind 
expand nearly 20% more slowly in the CPS than in the STEPS.

Eight Southeast Asian countries have targets to reach net zero emissions by years in the 
2050-2065 range. In the STEPS, regional CO2 emissions rise from 2 Gt today to 2.4 Gt by 2035. 
They start to plateau by the late 2040s, but fossil fuel consumption continues to increase by 
about 0.5% per year, and annual emissions reach 2.5 Gt by 2050. In the CPS, emissions rise 
to over 3 Gt by mid-century. 
Falling oil production and rising demand in the transport sector lead to net oil imports 
increasing in Southeast Asia from 3.3 mb/d in 2024 to 4.7 mb/d by 2035 in the STEPS and 
4.8 mb/d in the CPS. A combination of declining natural gas production and increasing 
demand shifts the region from a net exporter to a net importer of gas before the end of this 
decade. Demand for imported gas is met primarily through an increase in LNG imports by 
countries such as Singapore, Thailand, Philippines and Viet Nam, where the gas is mostly 
used to meet growing demand in the power and industry sectors. Net imports reach almost 
70 bcm in the STEPS by 2035 but are roughly 20% lower in the CPS, reflecting slightly weaker 
demand and higher domestic production.

Southeast Asia in the STEPS, 2015-2035

Southeast Asia is set to become a net importer of natural gas over the course  
of the next decade, while oil import dependency continues to increase  
Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; bcm = billion cubic metres; Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent. 
Coal production in Southeast Asia surged from 400 Mtce to 670 Mtce between 2015 and 
2024 as a result of rising consumption in the power sector and robust demand for exports, 
notably from China and India. The next decade, however, is set to mark a turnaround: in the 
STEPS, a slowdown in the rate of growth of domestic coal consumption and falling exports of 
Indonesian coal to China lead to a sustained decline in regional coal production to around

500 Mtce in 2035 (Figure 8.36). In the CPS, higher demand means that coal production 
declines more slowly than in the STEPS. 
8.11.2  Unpacking the fast growth of electricity demand and supply 
Southeast Asia recorded the second-fastest rate of electricity demand growth in 2024 among 
major regions and countries: only in China did it increase more rapidly. Demand was up by 
7% year-on-year, rising to 1 300 TWh, with Indonesia seeing the fastest rate of growth at 
over 9%. The rate of growth in 2024 was in line with the trend in recent years. Since 2015, 
the electricity demand in Southeast Asia has increased by 65%, with non-energy-intensive 
industries accounting for over 40% of it, supported by electrification of their processes. 
Today, its industrial electrification rate is comparable to that of the European Union. 
Southeast Asia remains one of the world’s fastest growing regions for industrial production 
to 2035. In the STEPS, electricity demand rises by around 4% a year to reach 2 100 TWh by 
2035 (Figure 8.37). Efficiency gains moderate demand growth, which would otherwise rise 
to about 6% per year. Non-energy-intensive industries account for more than 25% of the 
electricity demand growth to 2035. Annual demand from data centres increases from just 
over 10 TWh today to 25 TWh by 2030. Much of the data centre demand is concentrated in 
Singapore and the Johor province of Malaysia.

Rapid electricity demand growth since 2015 continues to increase to 2035,

Space cooling accounts for about a quarter of the electricity demand increase to 2035. Today, 
despite having among the highest cooling needs in the world, fewer than 30% of households 
in Southeast Asia have air conditioning. By 2035, the ownership ratio more than doubles in 
the STEPS to about the levels seen in advanced economies today. Over 30% of new cars sold 
by 2035 are electric in the STEPS, and around 15% in the CPS, up from around 10% today. 
The impact on overall electricity demand growth is small, but EVs displace around 0.5 mb/d 
of oil use in the STEPS by 2035, making oil demand 6% lower than it would be otherwise. 
Figure 8.38 ⊳ Electricity generation by source and average annual power 
sector investment in Southeast Asia in the STEPS, 2015-2035 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
 Natural gas, coal, wind and solar PV supply most of the additional power needed  
by 2035 in the STEPS and power sector investment increases significantly 
Notes: TWh = terawatt-hour; MER = market exchange rate. Other includes marine, concentrating solar power, 
waste-to-energy and other sources. 
Coal has met most of the increase in electricity demand over the past two decades in 
Southeast Asia. Demand for coal continues to rise in the STEPS, but it is supplanted by natural 
gas as the largest source of additional electricity. Meanwhile additions of wind and solar PV 
capacity accelerate, supported by policy initiatives and declining costs, and combined they 
account for 35% of the additional electricity generated in 2035 in the STEPS. Towards 2035, 
battery storage plays an increasingly important role to help integrate the rising share of 
variable renewables into the power grids, together with grid modernisation, demand 
response and measures to increase the flexibility of the conventional power plant fleet. 
Nuclear enters the supply mix after 2035, with both Indonesia and Viet Nam seeking to 
commission their first reactors by the middle of the next decade. Coal-fired electricity 
generation increases more strongly in the CPS, driven by slower uptake of wind and solar PV.

Meeting the projected growth in electricity demand and ensuring security of supply will 
require scaling up investment in generation, domestic networks and interconnections. In the 
STEPS, total power sector investment increases 80% to USD 60 billion in 2035 (Figure 8.38). 
Various sources of finance will be required to support the region’s energy and sustainability 
objectives, including a role for transition finance (Box 8.3). However, regulatory barriers, 
policy instability, high interest rates and a lack of public financial commitments remain 
barriers for the mobilisation of the necessary capital in the Southeast Asian emerging 
economies.  
Box 8.3 ⊳ 
Role of transition finance in Southeast Asia and the world 
Actions by the most emissions-intensive sectors, companies and countries are crucial to 
placing the world on a sustainable path, and efforts within the Southeast Asian region 
hold a position of particular importance. While there is strong attention on supporting 
green investment in the region, and such support will need to remain a priority going 
forward, such investment alone cannot deliver all the change needed to cut emissions, 
especially in areas where clean technologies are not yet commercially available or cost 
competitive. Transition finance can help emissions-intensive countries, companies, and 
sectors shift over time towards sustainable practices, aligned with long-term climate and 
development goals.  
At present, transition finance flows in Southeast Asia and elsewhere remain modest. But 
scenarios consistent with national or global emissions reduction targets suggest that 
USD 400-500 billion per year in transition finance could be mobilised over the next 
decade. This totals to USD 4-5 trillion in this period, with more than half directed to 
emerging market and developing economies. This is comparable in scale to the current 
global green bond market. Uptake has been slowed thus far by challenges associated with 
defining transition finance, but with credible government and corporate strategies, 
transition finance can help unlock investment for projects that fall outside the green 
finance label but are nonetheless essential for sustainable transitions (IEA, 2025f). 
Guidance on applying transition finance in Southeast Asia was prepared in the framework 
of the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum, a group of capital market regulators (ACMF, 2024). 
Recognising that not every company in the region is able to commit to a 1.5 °C target, the 
framework introduced a tiered approach to enable companies to be categorised as 
aligned and aligning to 1.5 °C, aligned and aligning to well below 2 °C, or those that are 
‘progressing’, referring to companies that have not yet committed to these targets, but 
are taking steps to align in the near future. The guidance provides entities with a 
framework to evaluate and demonstrate a credible transition in the region and to 
facilitate access to financing. It also recognises the need for flexibility to accommodate 
the region’s small and medium-size enterprises that may otherwise lack the capacity and 
expertise to participate in the market for transition finance.
