However, investment in emerging market and developing economies as a whole, excluding 
China, has declined by over 10% in recent years, despite rising electricity demand. Annual 
spending has increased in Africa by around USD 4 billion from 2013 levels, but it has 
contracted in Southeast Asia and India by 15% and 8% respectively.  
The picture needs to change. Grid investment in China more than doubles by 2035 in the 
CPS, as electricity demand continues to rise and renewables growth is much higher over the 
next decade than they were the last ten years. Investment in other emerging market and 
developing economies, which have recently lagged, nearly doubles to USD 160 billion 
annually by 2035, increasing at an annual rate of about 6%. By the mid-2030s, roughly two-
thirds of global grid investment is in emerging market and developing economies. Grid 
investment levels in advanced economies in the CPS, which have risen at a relatively rapid 
rate in recent years, stay at elevated levels and increase at an annual rate of around 2%, 
rising from USD 220 billion in 2024 to USD 275 billion in 2035.  
The rapid expansion of investment in electricity networks is already straining supply chains. 
Lead times for large power transformers and high-voltage cables have nearly doubled in 
many regions and wait times for HVDC systems stretch into the 2030s. Prices for key 
materials such as copper and aluminium remain high. European cable manufacturers are 
operating at full capacity, with order books committed for the next several years due to 
strong demand from interconnection and offshore wind projects. Labour shortages, 
especially of skilled technicians, engineers and project managers, alongside permitting 
hurdles, are also causing considerable delays and driving up costs. 
3.5 
Fossil fuels 
Oil and natural gas demand increase by 16% to 2035 and continue to rise through to 2050 
(Figure 3.28). Their prices also generally rise over this period. Oil demand in 2050 is 113 mb/d 
and natural gas demand is 5 600 bcm. To meet this demand, high levels of new resource 
development are necessary together with new fossil fuel infrastructure such as upstream 
facilities, pipelines, export and import terminals, and ships. The CPS also assumes that, by 
the latter part of the projection period, constraints on oil production and trade in countries 
currently subject to sanctions ease, so their output is determined by the underlying 
economics. This brings additional potential sources of supply into the picture, but their 
availability cannot be taken for granted if geopolitical constraints remain in place.  
Oil remains the dominant fuel to 2050 in the CPS. China accounted for more than 75% of oil 
demand growth over the past ten years, but this picture is changing, and India becomes the 
new epicentre of growth in oil demand.  
Half of the increase in demand for natural gas to 2035 is from the power and industry sectors 
in emerging market and developing economies in Asia Pacific and the Middle East. The global 
LNG market increases from around 560 bcm in 2024 to 880 bcm in 2035 and to 1 020 bcm in

2050. By 2035, the United States is both the world’s largest natural gas consumer at just over 
1 000 bcm and the world’s largest LNG exporter at 250 bcm.  
Coal use starts to decline globally before 2030, and by 2035 demand is around 8% lower than 
in 2024. Coal use in advanced economies declines by 35% to 2035 and it declines by 10% in 
China as renewable electricity expands and coal use in industry falls, although this drop is 
partially offset by continued growth in coal demand in other emerging market and 
developing economies.

Oil and natural gas demand continue to rise to 2050; coal use falls,

3.5.1 
Oil 
Demand 
Global demand for oil was 100 mb/d in 2024. In the CPS, it rises to 105 mb/d in 2035 and 
113 mb/d in 2050, an average annual increase of around 0.5 mb/d (Figure 3.29). The largest 
increases to 2035 are for oil use as petrochemical feedstock and other industrial activities, 
and in aviation. Demand in road transport in 2035 is similar to levels in 2024: by 2035, there 
are 430 million electric cars on the road worldwide – 60% of which are in China and 25% in 
Europe – and these avoid more than 6 mb/d of oil demand. Oil use for power generation falls 
by 2 mb/d to 2035, led by declines in countries in the Middle East. Nearly all of the growth 
in oil demand takes place in emerging market and developing economies, with some of the 
largest increases coming in India, Southeast Asia and Africa, and there is a continued decline 
in oil use in advanced economies. 
China accounted for more than 75% of oil demand growth globally between 2015 and 2024, 
but the outlook for its future is changing with the rapid electrification of its vehicle fleet and

its gradual shift to a less energy-intensive form of economic growth (Figure 3.30). Total oil 
demand in China falls slightly from around 16.2 mb/d in 2024 to 15.8 mb/d in 2035, mainly 
as a result of reduced oil use in road transport, although a large portion of this decline is 
offset by increased oil use as petrochemical feedstock.

to 2050

Global oil demand rises to 105 mb/d in 2035 and 113 mb/d in 2050 
 led by increases in petrochemical feedstock and aviation 
Notes: mb/d = million barrels per day; Other industries = industry sector excluding petrochemicals; 
Other = other non-energy use, other energy sectors, power, agriculture and other transport. Excludes biofuels. 
India leads global oil demand growth over the next ten years, with almost half of the 
additional barrels produced globally to 2035 heading in its direction. Its oil use increases from 
5.5 mb/d in 2024 to 8 mb/d in 2035 as a result of rapid growth in car ownership, increasing 
demand for plastics, chemicals and aviation, and a rise in the use of liquefied petroleum gas 
(LPG) for cooking. 
Oil demand in Africa rises by one-third to around 6 mb/d in 2035. Road transport accounts 
for about three-quarters of the increase, while oil use in the buildings sector – mainly in the 
form of LPG to replace the use of traditional solid biomass – also rises marginally, as does oil 
use in aviation and industry. 
Oil demand in the Middle East was around 8.5 mb/d in 2024 and increases by close to 1 mb/d 
to 2035 in the CPS. There is limited uptake of electric cars, partly because many countries in 
the region subsidise the use of gasoline and diesel, and efforts to expand the oil-to-chemicals 
value chain cause oil use as petrochemical feedstock to rise substantially. Increases in 
demand are partially offset by a 1 mb/d drop in oil use in power, mainly as a result of current 
policy plans in Saudi Arabia.

in the CPS, 2024-2035 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
India leads oil demand growth, followed by Southeast Asia and Africa, while oil demand 
growth for petrochemicals in China is fully offset by electrification in transport and buildings 
Notes: mb/d = million barrels per day; C & S America = Central and South America. Other = aviation, other 
industries, shipping, other non-energy use, other energy sectors, agriculture and other transport. 
Oil demand in advanced economies falls by around 3.5 mb/d to 2035, but there are large 
differences between countries. Around 80% of the drop occurs in Europe, and there are also 
reductions in Japan and Korea, Canada, and Australia and New Zealand, mainly as a result of 
current road transport electrification and space heating policies. Oil demand in other 
advanced economies increases slightly to 2035: there are some reductions of oil use in 
passenger cars as older cars are gradually replaced by more efficient versions, but these are 
more than offset by increases in freight transport and oil use as petrochemical feedstock. 
Supply 
Between 2015 and 2024, the United States increased supply by 8 mb/d while global oil 
demand increased by 6.5 mb/d (Figure 3.31). Meeting the rise in oil demand in the CPS to 
2050 requires contributions from a much wider range of supply sources. This includes more 
output from countries currently under sanctions, a willingness among low-cost producers to 
expand beyond announced capacity limits, and a substantial rise in oil prices to incentivise 
new exploration and development in higher cost regions. 
Non-OPEC+ supply rises by 4 mb/d to 2035 – three quarters of the increase in global oil 
demand over this period – led by increases in the United States, Canada, Guyana, Brazil and 
Argentina. Supply then falls back to 2024 levels by 2050. 
US oil supply reached a record high of 21 mb/d in 2024, and it increases by 0.8 mb/d to 2035 
in the CPS. The pace of growth to 2035 is slower than in recent years as an increasing amount

of new drilling is required to offset declines in existing shale plays. Total US production falls 
marginally after 2035, but the United States remains the largest producer worldwide to 2050 
in the CPS. 
Figure 3.31 ⊳ Oil supply by producer in the CPS to 2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
United States, Canada, Brazil, Guyana and Argentina all increase oil supply, while OPEC+ 
production grows markedly and in 2050 it produces 15% more than historic highs 
Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; UAE = United Arab Emirates. 
In Canada, oil supply increases from 6.1 mb/d in 2024 by 0.8 mb/d to 2035, driven mainly by 
debottlenecking oil sands operations and rising NGLs output from shale plays. Higher prices 
and expanding pipeline trade with the United States support a new wave of large-scale 
mining and in-situ extra-heavy oil and bitumen projects after 2035. 
Offshore production in Guyana rises from 0.6 mb/d in 2024 by 1.2 mb/d to 2035, with further 
increases thereafter, reliant on further exploration success. Output in Brazil increases by 
from 3.5 mb/d in 2024 by 1 mb/d to 2035, despite some delays in the commissioning of new 
floating production storage and offloading units. Output in Argentina rises to 1.4 mb/d in 
2035, its highest level ever, driven by tight oil development in the Vaca Muerta formation. 
Suriname’s first offshore barrels are assumed to come online in 2028 from the Sapakara and 
Krabdagu fields, and to be followed by additional developments. 
Africa produced more than 7 mb/d of oil in 2024. Production dips slightly to 2035, and then 
picks up again to 7 mb/d in 2050 in the CPS. Several countries in Africa, including Algeria, 
Libya, Nigeria, Cameroon and Angola, have launched new licensing rounds and are revising 
fiscal terms to attract new investment. There have been a number of major recent 
discoveries, including two large, liquids-rich discoveries in Namibia and Côte d’Ivoire, 
although these will take time to generate new supply.

OPEC+ supply increases from 50 mb/d in 2024 to 51 mb/d in 2035 and 63 mb/d in 2050 in 
the CPS. OPEC+ production in 2050 is 15% higher (8 mb/d) than at any point in the history of 
oil markets. Annual real revenues for members of OPEC+ from oil production rise from 
USD 1.4 trillion in 2024 to 1.7 USD trillion in 2035 and USD 2.5 trillion in 2050, which is 
around 25% higher than the level in 2022 during the global energy crisis. 
Saudi Arabia leads production growth to 2035 as it develops new onshore and offshore fields, 
increases natural gas liquids (NGLs) production, and draws on its giant unconventional 
Jafurah field. Conventional crude oil production from Saudi Arabia, excluding NGLs and 
production from the neutral zone, rises beyond its current announced maximum sustainable 
capacity level of 12 mb/d from the mid-2040s and exceeds 13 mb/d by 2050 in the CPS.  
Supply in Iraq grows marginally from today’s level to 4.6 mb/d in 2035, which depends on 
progress in water injection capabilities to maintain production. The United Arab Emirates 
boost production by 0.6 mb/d to 4.8 mb/d in 2035, most of which comes from increased 
NGLs production. 
A gradual normalisation of the international situation in countries subject to sanctions –
notably Russia, Iran and Venezuela – is assumed in the CPS. Supply from these three 
countries remains flat to 2035 and then increases over the longer term by 4 mb/d to 2050, 
reaching 20 mb/d in 2050. However, sanctions could remain in place on these countries for 
longer, in which case additional supply would need to come from elsewhere. Increases above 
the levels of the CPS may be possible from the United States, Canada, Brazil and other major 
resource-holders in the Middle East, but this would require additional investment and would 
very likely entail higher prices (Box 3.3). 
Russian oil supply fell by 0.3 mb/d in 2024 to 10.7 mb/d, largely due to sanctions, rising costs 
and infrastructural challenges. Supply remains around this level through to 2050 in the CPS, 
supported by progress in the Vostok Oil Project in the 2030s and increased output from 
currently hard-to-access resources which offset declines in its legacy supergiant fields.  
Box 3.3 ⊳ 
How high and for how long can US tight oil production rise? 
The growth of tight oil production in the United States in recent years has far surpassed 
anything seen previously in the history of oil supply. Production rose by 0.5 mb/d each 
year on average between 2015 and 2024 to 9 mb/d, which was roughly equivalent to 
adding current oil production in Guyana to the global balance every year. Tight oil wells 
are characterised by high initial production followed by steep decline, with continued 
drilling essential to maintain and extend production. US tight oil production is particularly 
sensitive to the oil price, and the dip in prices at the beginning of 2025 had an immediate 
impact on future production projections. 
In the CPS, the oil price rises to around USD 90 per barrel in 2035, unlocking around 
USD 60 billion average annual investment to 2035 as the price moves up (around 20% 
less than was invested in the sector in 2024). Tight crude oil and condensate production

rises by around 1.4 mb/d to 2035 in the CPS. This increase depends on increased 
investment and on the timely development of new infrastructure to avoid bottlenecks 
(Figure 3.32). 
Figure 3.32 ⊳ US tight crude oil and condensate production at various 
average annual levels of investment in the CPS to 2035 
  
IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
US tight oil production rises by 1.4 mb/d to 2035; it could rise by an additional  
2.5 mb/d if investment averages around the highest levels seen in recent years 
Higher investment levels than in the CPS would lead to larger production increases. 
Nonetheless, higher spending and drilling activity tend to be associated with rising input 
costs, production levels are limited by the overall level of oil that can be recovered,5 and 
recent evidence suggests that wells in a number of the key US tight oil plays are becoming 
more gas-rich. The industry is increasingly focused on maximising returns to shareholders 
and maintaining capital discipline. If annual investment averaged USD 90 billion to 2035 
– similar to the highest ever levels seen in tight oil in 2018 and 2019 – then we estimate 
that tight oil production could rise to around 13 mb/d in 2035. 
Refining 
Oil use as petrochemical feedstock and jet fuel consumption increase by 2% each year on 
average to 2035 in the CPS. Aggregate gasoline and diesel demand stays broadly flat to 2035, 
with declines in advanced economies and China broadly offsetting increases in other 
emerging market and developing economies: the balance changes after 2040, leading to a 
5% rise in road transport fuel demand to 2050 (Figure 3.33).

Around 9 mb/d of new refining capacity comes online in the CPS between 2024 and 2035. 
With around 5 mb/d in closures over this period, net refining throughput increases by 
4 mb/d. Asia sees a net increase of around 3 mb/d in refining capacity between 2024 and 2035, 
led by increases in India. Since 2022, India has emerged as a global swing supplier, refining 
volumes of Russian crude oil exports that previously flowed to Europe. India’s refining 
capacity grows from 6 mb/d in 2024 by 1.5 mb/d to 2035 which solidifies its role as a key 
exporter of transport fuel. The refinery and petrochemical rationalisation programme in 
China shuts down some capacity, but additions and retrofits keep overall capacity levels 
broadly flat at just under 19 mb/d to 2035, and falling domestic demand drives a rise in oil 
product exports.  
Figure 3.33 ⊳ Demand for selected refined and fractionated products, 2015-
2050 and refinery runs by region in the CPS, 2024-2035 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Demand for petrochemical feedstock rises much more strongly than demand for 
other refined products, while Asia increasingly cements itself as a refining hub 
Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; Petrochemical feedstock = naphtha, liquefied petroleum gases and 
ethane used as a feedstock; diesel, gasoline and kerosene includes transport use only. 
Refining capacity in the Middle East increased notably in recent years (to 11.5 mb/d in 2024), 
largely driven by Saudi Arabia, reflecting a strategic focus on increasing downstream 
integration. In the CPS, it rises by an additional 1.7 mb/d to 2035. In Africa, around 0.7 mb/d 
of new capacity comes online by 2035, including the Dangote refinery in Nigeria, (not yet at 
full capacity in early 2025). In North America, new refining capacity mostly comes online after 
2035, increasing its total capacity to just over 22 mb/d in 2050, driven by rising domestic 
demand for petrochemical products, kerosene and diesel. Refining capacity in Europe falls 
from 16 mb/d in 2024 by 2.5 mb/d to 2035, reflecting both lower demand and a loss of 
competitiveness.

How could natural gas liquids momentum shift? 
Natural gas liquids (NGLs) are hydrocarbons separated and extracted from natural gas 
streams during processing. They include both condensates and natural gas plant liquids. 
NGLs production increased by one-third over the past decade, reaching 21 mb/d in 2024. 
As production rose, NGL-derived ethane and LPG increased in importance as low-cost 
competitors to crude oil-derived chemical inputs, sources of petrochemical feedstock 
and fuels for cooking. 
Figure 3.34 ⊳ NGLs production by region in the CPS to 2035  
 
 IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
NGLs help meet growing demand for petrochemical feedstock,  
with Saudi Arabia and Qatar production set to accelerate over the next decade  
Note: mb/d = million barrels per day. 
Production of NGLs expands to 24 mb/d by 2035 in the CPS (Figure 3.34). Two-thirds of 
this is from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, where it is supported by the ramp-up of the Jafurah 
field and increases in output from the North Field. A further 20% of the increase is from 
North America, mainly from increased shale gas production: many US shale basins deliver 
high NGLs yields. NGLs production in the Middle East rises more rapidly to 2035 while 
North American output sustains the highest volumes even as the rate of growth 
stabilises. This means that the main supply centres for NGLs will be increasingly balanced 
between the Atlantic basin and east of Suez, which has important implications for the 
geography of oil product trade flows. 
Trade 
The Middle East exports 21 mb/d of oil today – around 50% of global net oil exports – and it 
remains by far the world’s largest oil exporter through to 2050 in the CPS (Figure 3.35). Net 
exports from North America increase by around 1.5 mb/d to more than 7 mb/d in 2035 and

then fall in the 2040s as domestic supply declines slightly. Net exports from Russia in 2035 
(7 mb/d) are about 0.2 mb/d lower than those of North America, but Russia becomes the 
world’s second-largest net oil exporter again by 2050 as North American exports decline in 
the 2040s. Exports from Central and South America more than double between 2024 and 
2050, driven by surges in production from Guyana and Argentina, and later by Venezuela. 
Africa stops being a net oil exporter soon after 2035, following gradual declines in production 
and a 2.8 mb/d increase in demand between 2035 and 2050. 
Figure 3.35 ⊳ Net oil trade for exporters and importers in the CPS to 2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Middle East dominates global net exports today and it remains by far the  
largest exporter to 2050; India and Southeast Asia have rapidly rising import needs 
Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; C & S America = Central and South America. 
China overtook Europe as the world’s largest crude oil importer in 2020, and it keeps this 
position in the CPS through to 2050, even though its imports do not increase materially. Its 
import dependency increases from 73% in 2024 to nearly 80% in 2035, while import 
dependency in India rises from 87% in 2024 to 92% in 2035, despite government efforts to 
promote domestic production. Oil imports to Europe have remained around 10 mb/d over 
the last decade, but its demand for oil falls by more than 20% to 2035 and halves by 2050 in 
the CPS. As a result, oil imports to Europe drop to around 6 mb/d in 2050, even though 
domestic production drops by 2 mb/d to 2050.  
Global oil trade shifts eastward, boosting the strategic importance of the Strait of Malacca, 
where the volumes of oil handled in the CPS rise from 24 mb/d in 2024 (30% of global oil 
trade) to 28 mb/d by 2035. Volumes through the Strait of Hormuz also rise by just under 
1.5 mb/d to 2035, reaching 21.5 m/d.

Natural gas 
Demand 
Natural gas demand has increased on average by around 80 bcm per year over the last ten 
years. In the CPS, it increases by around 70 bcm every year to 2035, and by 2035 natural gas 
overtakes coal to become the second-largest fuel in terms of demand. Emerging market and 
developing economies are responsible for nearly all of this growth – their collective needs 
increase by 700 bcm to 2035 – with demand in advanced economies remaining broadly flat 
(Figure 3.36). By 2050, global natural gas demand in the CPS reaches 5 600 bcm, a 30% 
increase compared with 2024, and emerging market and developing economies account for 
two-thirds of global demand, up from 55% today.  
Figure 3.36 ⊳ Global natural gas demand by sector and region in the CPS 
to 2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Natural gas demand increases by 20% to 2035 and by 30% to 2050, driven by expanding 
use in power generation and in industry, particularly in Asia Pacific and Middle East 
Note: bcm = billion cubic metres; Int. bunkers = international bunkers; Other = other energy sector and 
agriculture. 
Demand in emerging market and developing economies in Asia increases by 340 bcm 
between 2024 and 2035, in line with historical trends. Around 35% is more demand from the 
power sector and another 35% from industry. This is accompanied by investment in new 
infrastructure: the region adds 270 GW of new gas-fired power generation capacity to 2035, 
a 70% increase on current levels. Natural gas demand in China rises by 200 bcm to 630 bcm 
between 2024 and 2035, which is more than the growth in demand from all other emerging 
market and developing economies in Asia combined. Natural gas demand in India nearly 
doubles to 2035 to reach 140 bcm, led by growth in its city-gas distribution sector.  
The Middle East is a major source of natural gas demand growth. Its use of gas expands by 
240 bcm between 2024 and 2035. It is broad-based: the power and industry sectors together

account for two-thirds of the increase, but more gas is also consumed in the oil and gas 
sector, for example in LNG liquefaction.  
Demand in advanced economies increases by 50 bcm between 2024 and 2035 in the CPS. In 
the United States, demand increases by around 10% to more than 1 000 bcm in 2035, led by 
a 50 bcm increase in the use of gas for electricity generation and an additional 15 bcm to run 
LNG liquefaction terminals. Natural gas demand in the European Union falls by just over 10% 
to less than 300 bcm in 2035 as current policy measures to reduce reliance on gas imports 
and increase the share of renewables take effect. In Japan, demand rises marginally from 
90 bcm in 2024 to 95 bcm by 2035. In Korea, demand stays flat at 60 bcm. 
Supply 
Meeting the rise in natural gas demand in the CPS requires an acceleration in investment in 
a wide range of supply sources. The Middle East sees the largest expansion in supply of any 
region in the CPS, and its share of global production rises from 17% in 2024 to 22% in 2035 
(Figure 3.37). Qatar leads the way within the region, increasing output from 170 bcm in 2024 
to over 300 bcm in 2035, and most of this additional output is used to boost its LNG exports. 
Saudi Arabia ramps up production of non-associated gas, increasing output by more than 
75 bcm between 2024 and 2035 to meet growing electricity demand and to substitute for oil 
in the power system. Its Jafurah field, the region’s largest unconventional, non-associated 
gas field, began production in 2024 and output is projected to exceed 20 bcm within five 
years. At peak production, it will provide nearly 15% of Saudi Arabia’s total gas output.

Today the United States is the world’s largest gas producer, accounting for over one-quarter 
of global supply, 1 070 bcm, and it increases production in the CPS by 210 bcm to 2035 
(Figure 3.38). The shale revolution shows some signs of maturation, and the average annual 
increase in shale gas production in the CPS to 2035 is around one-half of the level seen over 
the previous decade. In 2024, the United States exported around 18% of its natural gas 
production; this rises to more than 25% in 2035. The benchmark Henry Hub price rises to 
around USD 4.5 per million British thermal units in 2035 to support the production of the 
new supplies needed to cover these larger volumes of export alongside rising domestic 
demand.  
Figure 3.38 ⊳ Natural gas by producing country in the CPS, 2024 and 2035 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
All major producers invest in new supply to meet rising domestic demand or to boost 
exports, with nearly 80% of the global increase in supply from today’s top-ten producers 
Note: bcm = billion cubic metres. 
Natural gas production in Canada rises by 35 bcm to 250 bcm in 2035 in the CPS. Around 
two-thirds of this growth comes from its shale resource base, which, building on the 
commissioning of LNG Canada in 2025, is increasingly supporting the country’s entrance to 
the club of LNG exporters. 
Natural gas production in Russia stays flat around 680 bcm to 2035, as do its exports, at 
around 160 bcm, and it is assumed that domestic prices increase to compensate for falling 
export revenue. Gas fields in West Siberia get a second lease on life from the mid-2030s as 
the Power of Siberia II pipeline to China ramps up. This enables the legacy Yamburg and 
Urengoy fields to maintain output, with modest upside for the newer Bovanenkovo basin.  
The prospects for natural gas production in Australia differ by region and total production is 
broadly flat to 2035 (at around 165 bcm). Structural supply deficits on its east coast make it

difficult to meet domestic demand while maintaining LNG exports from Queensland. In the 
west, supply growth from the offshore Carnarvon and Browse basins, among others, helps 
offset declines elsewhere, helping maintain Australia’s position as the dominant regional 
LNG supplier.  
Gas production in Africa rises in aggregate by 30 bcm to 2035, with increases in countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa more than offsetting declines in North Africa. In North Africa, Algeria and 
Libya have opened new exploration acreage in a bid to reinvigorate foreign inward 
investment, and in the CPS, this partially offsets declining production in existing fields. In 
Nigeria, efforts to boost the upstream sector lead to a near 15 bcm increase in natural gas 
production to 2035, and expansion of the LNG liquefaction plant on Bonny Island is set to 
further strengthen its position as an LNG exporter. Mozambique is also poised to increase 
production to support LNG exports, as the 18 bcm Mozambique LNG project is assumed to 
start around 2030. Other new gas producers also emerge in Africa, notably Senegal, where 
production increases to around 15 bcm by 2035.  
In Argentina, production is set to increase by 60% to 2035, bringing the total to around 
75 bcm, led by increases in the Vaca Muerta formation, which has large volumes of 
associated gas. There is also a small increase in gas production in Brazil, but production falls 
in most other countries in Central and South America. Overall, the region sees a net increase 
of 25 bcm in natural gas production between 2024 and 2035. 
Trade 
Around 1 100 bcm of natural gas was traded over long distances in 2024, 45% by long-
distance pipeline and 55% as LNG. A large new wave of LNG capacity is set to come online 
over the period to 2030: this new capacity is fully utilised in the CPS, mainly through 
increased exports to emerging market and developing economies in Asia. Total LNG trade 
expands from 560 bcm in 2024 to 880 bcm in 2035. Over this period, LNG imports by Europe 
grow by 80 bcm, while imports by countries in Asia rise by 240 bcm; more than 70% of all 
LNG exports are shipped to Asia in 2035 (Figure 3.39). 
China imported more than 100 bcm of LNG in 2024 – the largest amount of any country – 
and another 80 bcm of natural gas by pipeline. Its LNG imports have fallen to date in 2025 as 
a result of high LNG prices, robust domestic production and increased pipeline imports from 
Russia. In the CPS, its LNG imports rise by 75 bcm to 2035, while pipeline gas imports 
increase by 40 bcm, with roughly 65% of the increase from Russia and the rest from Central 
Asia.  
Southeast Asia imported around 35 bcm of LNG in 2024. Rapidly rising demand and declining 
domestic gas production increase this to 80 bcm by 2035 in the CPS, and an additional 50 bcm 
per year of regasification capacity is built to accommodate this growth. In 2035, India imports 
50 bcm of LNG, up from 35 bcm today. Other emerging markets in Asia, particularly Pakistan 
and Bangladesh, import around 75 bcm of LNG in 2035, a 60% increase on 2024 levels.

Japan and Korea – long-time leaders and first movers in the LNG industry – remain fully 
dependent on LNG to meet gas demand. Their combined imports rise by around 10 bcm to 
2035 in the CPS.

the CPS, 2024-2035

LNG imports surge in Asia as domestic production fails to match growth in demand  
Note: LNG = liquefied natural gas. 
The United States is the world’s largest LNG exporter. It delivered 120 bcm in 2024 to more 
than 45 countries, with its flexible, destination-free contracts allowing cargoes to be 
redirected quickly in response to market shifts. Its export capacity doubles by 2030, and it 
maintains its current role as the largest LNG exporter through to 2050 in the CPS. It exports 
more than 250 bcm of LNG in 2035, half of which goes to Asia, up from 30% in 2024 
(Figure 3.40).  
The Middle East, led by Qatar, doubles its LNG exports in the CPS to 260 bcm in 2035, with 
the Ruwais LNG complex in the United Arab Emirates adding more than 10 bcm of new 
capacity by 2028. 
Russia doubles gas exports to China from 40 bcm in 2024 to 80 bcm in 2035. The Power of 
Siberia I pipeline is currently operating at full capacity, and the Power of Siberia II pipeline, 
with nameplate capacity of 50 bcm, is assumed to ramp up from the mid-2030s. Russia also 
increases exports to the Caspian region. Russia’s annual LNG exports remain around the 
current level of 50 bcm in 2035. Despite finding some alternative export outlets for its gas 
since its invasion of Ukraine closed off many of its previous ones, Russia’s net income from 
natural gas exports remains below 2021 levels out to 2050 in the CPS.

3.5.3 
Coal 
Demand 
Since 2000, coal has been the fastest growing fossil fuel in the global energy mix. Global coal 
demand has nearly doubled since then, and reached the record level of 6 090 million tonnes 
of coal equivalent (Mtce) in 2024. Growth has been driven mainly by the use of coal to 
generate power in emerging market and developing economies, in particular China and India. 
However, in the CPS, global coal demand peaks before 2030 and then declines gradually: by 
2035, demand is around 8% lower than 2024 levels, with a 315 Mtce reduction of coal use in 
power generation partially offset by a 30 Mtce increase in use in industry. By 2050, global 
coal use is around 20% lower than today (Figure 3.41).  
The power sector currently accounts for around two-thirds of global coal demand. In the CPS, 
the increase in renewables electricity generation to 2035 corresponds to more than 85% of 
the increase in global electricity demand. As a result, renewables start to edge coal out in 
most regions apart from Southeast Asia. Meanwhile coal use in industry rises in several 
emerging market and developing economies. For example, coal demand for the industry 
sector in India increases by 60% to 2035 and in Indonesia by more than 45%. China sees a 
16% reduction in coal use in industry to 2035, a drop of 150 Mtce, mainly in its iron and steel 
sub-sector.

Coal demand has fallen by around 40% since 2015 in advanced economies. It declines by a 
further 35% to 2035 as old coal-fired power plants are gradually retired: coal use in power 
falls by around 45% to 2035, and in industry it falls by around 5% from a low base. 
Figure 3.41 ⊳ Coal demand by sector and region/country in the CPS to 2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Coal use peaks before 2030, mainly as demand declines in China and in 
advanced economies; only coal use in industry remains resilient to 2050 
Note: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent; AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and 
developing economies. 
Box 3.5 ⊳  Could coal demand continue to increase? 
A growth story for coal over the coming decades cannot entirely be ruled out but it would 
fly in the face of two crucial structural trends witnessed in recent years: the rise of 
renewable sources of power generation, and the shift in China away from an especially 
coal-intensive model of growth and infrastructure development. As such, sustained 
growth for coal demand appears highly unlikely. Nonetheless it is useful to explore the 
circumstances under which it could take place (Figure 3.42). 
More than any other fuel, the dynamics in coal markets are determined by a handful of 
countries, mostly in Asia. By far, China is the most notable, followed by India, Indonesia 
and other countries in Southeast Asia. The average age of the coal-fired power plants in 
emerging market and developing economies in Asia is around 15 years, so many of them 
could in theory have a long operational future; however, continued growth in coal use 
would also imply the construction of substantial additional plants. 
Continued growth in coal demand could take place if the expansion of wind and solar PV 
electricity generation ended. Electricity generation from wind and solar PV increases by 
around 1 000 TWh on average every year in the CPS between 2024 and 2035. Integration

challenges as well as tariffs or other trade measures could hinder the level of expansion 
in some markets projected in the CPS. If the annual increase in global wind and solar PV 
generation was more in line with the 2024 level, 650 TWh, it would imply an additional 
450 Mtce of coal demand in 2035 based on the current global power mix. Yet multiple 
factors push in the opposite direction, including the underlying economics and strong 
industrial interest in the manufacture and deployment of wind and solar PV, notably in 
China. 
Figure 3.42 ⊳ Factors that could lead to continued coal growth above the 
levels of the CPS to 2035 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Further increases in demand for coal could reflect a huge slowdown in clean 
technology deployment and a major reduction in efficiency gains 
Note: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent; CPS = Current Policies Scenario. 
Electricity demand is another important variable: it increases by around 3% each year to 
2035 in the CPS, which is similar to the average rate of growth in the last decade. But 
electricity demand increased by 4.2% in 2024. If the rate of demand growth were to be 
maintained through to 2035, it would imply an additional 380 Mtce of coal, assuming no 
changes in the power generation mix. 
Coal demand could also be affected at the margin by slower increases in power sector 
efficiency. The CPS includes a slight increase in efficiency as older, less efficient plants are 
retired, or by reducing coal-to-gas switching in some markets, but neither of these factors 
are game-changers on their own. 
In practice, the considerations that seem most likely to affect the pace at which the world 
moves away from coal concern the social consequences of change. As countries that have 
been down this route will attest, coal transitions are challenging (IEA, 2022). The 
implications of declining production on coal-dependent communities and regions can be

substantial, and could prove to be more important than the economics of power 
generation in determining the rate of change. In the CPS, the decline of coal demand is 
relatively gradual, and would only continue an existing trend. China, for example, has 
already seen a huge reduction in its coal workforce as the sector modernised over the 
last ten years. In some circumstances, however, a prolonged role for coal could be driven 
by social or other political considerations. 
Supply 
Coal production in China expanded by around 2 300 Mtce between 2000 and 2024, which 
represents nearly three-quarters of the growth in global coal production over the period. In 
the CPS, production in China declines by 10% from close to 3 350 Mtce in 2024 to just over 
2 900 Mtce in 2035 (Figure 3.43). 
Figure 3.43 ⊳ Coal production by region/country and type in the CPS to 2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Coal production falls gradually in most major producers;  
declines are steeper for steam coal, lignite and peat than for coking coal 
Note: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent; AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and 
developing economies. 
In India, reflecting strong domestic demand and supportive policies, coal production reached 
almost 600 Mtce in 2024, an increase of nearly 100 Mtce since 2022. In the CPS, India sees 
the largest increase in coal production, adding 100 Mtce to its annual output by 2035.  
Most other emerging market and developing economies reduce coal output, though a few 
countries in Africa and Asia that currently produce small amounts of coal see modest 
increases in production to 2035 in the CPS. In South Africa, steam coal production falls by

around 20%, mainly as a result of lower demand; export-oriented steam coal producers, such 
as Colombia, see larger reductions. 
Coal production in advanced economies, totalling 1 000 Mtce in 2024, has fallen by roughly 
400 Mtce since 2015. This downward trajectory continues in the CPS, albeit at a slower pace, 
with production falling by around 250 Mtce to 2035. 
The production outlook varies by coal type (Figure 3.44). Steam coal is mostly used for power 
generation and accounts for around 80% of world production today, and its production falls 
by just over 10% to 2035. Coking coal is mostly used in iron and steel production, and its 
production expands in several countries. A key exception is China, where it falls by more than 
20% to 2035 in the CPS. Lignite and peat production have the steepest falls, a drop of around 
45% to 2035, mostly due to mine closures in Europe.

India is one of the few countries to continue to significantly ramp up coal production  
Note: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent. 
Indonesia – the world’s largest steam coal exporter – sees a production drop of about 20% 
from 2024 to 2035 in the CPS, despite growth of nearly 45% in domestic coal demand. 
Australia – the world’s largest coking coal exporter – sees a 15% drop in production to 2035, 
and a fall of 45% in domestic demand, mainly for steam coal used in power generation. Russia 
and Mongolia also see declines in production as China, their main export destination, reduces 
its imports.

Chapter 4 
Stated Policies Scenario 
Stepping up the pace of change? 
• The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) is an exploratory scenario, designed to reflect the 
prevailing direction of travel for the energy system based on a detailed reading of 
country-specific energy, climate and related industrial policies that have been 
adopted or put forward, even if not yet codified in law. It reflects the state of 
technology and market conditions but does not include aspirational goals. 
• Total final consumption grows 1% annually to 2035 in the STEPS, with India and other 
emerging market and developing economies leading demand growth. It increases 
more slowly than in the past decade as efficiency gains accelerate to 2.2% per year, 
driven by the increasing electrification of end-uses. 
• Oil demand peaks at 102 million barrels per day (mb/d) around 2030 before gradually 
declining. Global electric car sales share rises from over 20% today to over 50% by 
2035, despite lower electric vehicle (EV) sales in the United States in this Outlook. In 
2035, over 840 million EVs displace 10 mb/d of oil, mainly in Asia and Europe. Oil use 
for petrochemicals and aviation continues to increase to 2035 and 2050. Natural gas 
demand increases nearly 1% annually to 2035, supported by abundant supply and 
major liquefied natural gas (LNG) expansions in the United States and Qatar, then 
levels off. Coal demand peaks before 2030 as declines in China outweigh increases in 
India and Southeast Asia. 
• From the 2030s, renewables in aggregate meet all additional global energy demand 
as they provide increasing amounts of generation in a rapidly expanding power sector. 
The renewables share in electricity generation rises from one-third today to over half 
by 2035 and two-thirds by 2050, led by solar and wind power with support from 
batteries. Grid upgrades and dispatchable sources are critical to maintain security. 
Nuclear output grows 40% to 2035, maintaining a 9% share of electricity generation. 
• The world moves firmly into the Age of Electricity in the STEPS, with electricity use 
rising four-times faster than overall energy demand to 2035. In advanced economies, 
EVs and data centres push up electricity demand. In emerging market and developing 
economies, rising incomes boost demand for appliances and air conditioners. 
• Dynamism in the electricity sector is not matched by the rise of low-emissions fuels: 
liquid biofuels and biogases do well in some markets, but new fuels generally struggle 
to gain market share and remain heavily dependent on policy support to compete. 
• Energy-sector CO₂ emissions peak near term at just over 38 gigatonne (Gt), falling to 
35 Gt by the mid-2030s and below 30 Gt by 2050 – a level last seen in 2005 – driven 
mainly by reduced coal use in China’s power sector. Emissions from end-use sectors 
flatten but do not decline significantly. Europe sees one of the largest percentage 
drops. By 2100, the global temperature is projected to rise by 2.5 °C.

4.1 
Introduction 
The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) has a long pedigree in the International Energy Agency 
(IEA) family of scenarios. It was introduced in 2019 with this name, but it has much in 
common with the previous New Policies Scenario that dates back to the 2010 edition of the 
World Energy Outlook (WEO). The intention of this scenario is to reflect the prevailing 
direction of travel for the energy system based on a detailed reading of the latest policy 
settings in countries around the world. It takes into account specific energy, climate and 
related industrial policies that have been adopted or put forward, as well as policy intentions 
not yet codified into law but supported by markets, infrastructure and financial conditions. 
(See Chapter 2 for full scenario descriptions and Annex B for underlying assumptions). 
Like the Current Policies Scenario detailed in Chapter 3, the STEPS is an exploratory scenario 
in that it does not target a predetermined outcome. Instead, it sets the starting conditions 
and sees where they lead. As such, it does not assume that aspirational goals, such as those 
included in some Nationally Determined Contributions, are achieved. It is grounded in what 
policies are actually in place or planned across different sectors of the energy economy.  
This does not make the STEPS a forecast – as we have said on many occasions, the IEA does 
not have a long-term forecast. Policies and circumstances will undoubtedly change, and we 
do not seek to anticipate or predict those changes. The aim of this scenario, and of the 
Outlook as a whole, is simply to provide a coherent, rigorous, data-driven framework for 
assessing how the energy sector might evolve, to better inform the important decisions that 
are being taken today. 
The methodology for the STEPS has been consistent over time, but the modelling approaches 
have evolved across successive iterations of the scenario. Among other things, there has 
been a concerted effort to develop insights into energy supply chains, including those for 
critical minerals. Work on electricity has been underpinned by granular hourly modelling of 
the operation of power systems, and by detailed consideration of new sources of demand 
such as data centres and artificial intelligence (AI). New geospatial analysis is now a regular 
feature of this IEA modelling and analysis. 
This chapter presents the new projections for the STEPS to 2050, starting with an overview 
of the broad energy demand outlook and the implications for emissions. It then goes into 
more detail on end-use sectors, examining among other things the future of the global 
vehicle fleet, the rapid growth in demand for cooling, and the ways in which some important 
trends  are affecting the outlook for industry. The power sector section looks in detail at the 
onset of the Age of Electricity, which is characterised by strong demand growth across 
multiple sectors and continued structural changes in  generation, and includes an exploration 
of its implications for grid infrastructure. The outlook for fuels is covered in the concluding 
sections, including oil, natural gas and coal as well as low-emissions fuels. Among other 
elements, it examines the drivers of demand and supply, and the prospective major 
expansion of trade in liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Overview 
4.2.1 
Total energy demand 
Total energy demand increases from 654 exajoules (EJ) today to over 705 EJ in 2035, an 
increase that is roughly equivalent to the current energy demand in the European Union. 
Global gross domestic product (GDP) is assumed to rise at around 3% a year to 2035, in line 
with its rate of growth over the past decade, while total energy demand growth halves from 
an annual average of 1.6% over the past decade to 0.7% over the period to 2035. This 
continued decoupling of GDP and energy use reflects a rise  in energy intensity improvements 
from an average of 1.4% per year over the past decade to 2.2% per year through to 2035. 
These improvements, which are chiefly driven by end-use electrification and efficiency gains 
from the uptake of renewables, mean that the energy ultimately available to end-users, i.e. 
useful energy, net of all conversion losses across the system, rises at virtually the same rate 
over the next decade as the last one (Figure 4.1). Growth in both total energy demand and 
in useful energy is fastest in emerging market and developing economies other than China, 
which enables economic development and welfare gains.

Fossil fuels reach high points in the next decade before being overtaken by renewables  
as total demand growth slows, but the energy available to end-users does not 
Note: EJ = exajoule. 
The fossil fuel shares in total energy demand decline from 79% today to 71% in 2035. Coal 
demand initially remains broadly stable at its current level of 6 090 million tonnes of coal 
equivalent (Mtce), but it peaks before 2030 and then declines to under 4 900 Mtce in 2035 
as it is edged out of the power sector. Oil demand rises slowly to around 102 million barrels

per day (mb/d) by 2030 before beginning a slow decline in subsequent years, with reductions 
in oil demand for road transport broadly offset by increased oil use for petrochemicals. 
Natural gas demand rises by 1% per year to 2035, driven mainly by growth in industry and 
power, and then remains stable. Demand for renewables increases by an average of 5.5% 
per year to 2035: most of the additional demand comes from the power sector, but the direct 
use of renewables also increases, particularly in industry and biofuels in transport. 
Renewable power capacity expands 2.6-times from 2022 to 2030, and 3.7-times by 2035. 
Nuclear capacity increases by 3% on average to 2035. 
Today, around one-third of global energy demand is in advanced economies and two-thirds 
is in emerging market and developing economies. Between now and 2035, energy demand 
growth comes primarily from emerging market and developing economies, led by India, 
Southeast Asia, Middle East, China and Africa. While most of the growth in demand for oil 
and natural gas comes from emerging market and developing economies, demand for low-
emissions sources increase in all regions (Figure 4.2).

Emerging market and developing economies drive growth in total energy demand;

Total energy demand is 4% higher by 2035 in the STEPS in this Outlook than in the version in 
the World Energy Outlook-2024 (WEO-2024). The differences are largely due to upward 
revisions in coal demand (10% or 440 Mtce higher in 2035 in this Outlook, mainly for use in 
power generation in China and United States), and in natural gas demand (8% or 350 billion 
cubic metres [bcm])  higher in 2035 in this Outlook mainly for use in power generation in the 
United States. The changes in China are driven by major regulatory changes for renewables

that moderate their near-term growth, together with an expectation of more rapid growth 
in electricity output. In the United States, both regulatory shifts and higher expectations for 
data centre demand drive the changes to the outlook. Demand for nuclear power has also 
been revised upward (4% higher in 2035 in this Outlook), which reflects an expanded pipeline 
of projects and increased policy momentum, particularly in some European countries.  
Demand for renewables has been revised downward in this STEPS (3% lower in 2035) 
primarily due to policy and regulatory changes in the United States. 
4.2.2 
CO2 emissions 
Global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions totalled 38 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2024. In 
the STEPS, they peak in the next few years and fall to around 35 Gt by 2035, a level last seen 
in 2015. By 2050, global CO2 emissions are below 30 Gt, a level last seen in 2005. The 
reduction in emissions is primarily driven by changes in power generation (Figure 4.3), where 
the share of fossil fuels drops from around 60% today to less than 40% in 2035 and about 20% 
in 2050. Increased demand for renewables and further electrification of end-uses are the 
leading sources of emissions reductions through to 2035 and then to 2050. Although global 
energy-related emissions have yet to peak, CO2 emissions per capita did so in 2013, and they 
continue to decline through to 2035 and beyond. 
Figure 4.3 ⊳ 
CO2 emissions by sector and region in the STEPS, 2015-2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Changes in the power generation mix drive an overall reduction in energy-related  
CO2 emissions, with reduced coal use as the main driver, especially in China 
Note: Gt CO2 = gigatonnes of carbon dioxide; C & S America = Central and South America. 
Coal is the largest source of CO2 emissions today, making up over 40% of the global total. 
Reductions in coal use bring about a 3.1 Gt decrease in CO2 emissions to 2035, more than the 
overall net reduction by 2035. In parallel, emissions from oil use decline by 660 million

tonnes (Mt), while natural gas emissions rise by 860 Mt. Natural gas accounted for almost 
half of the growth in CO2 emissions over the last decade; it is also responsible for an 
increasing share of CO2 emissions in the coming years as coal-to-gas switching continues in 
the power sector and as demand for gas rises in industry. 
Underlying the global trend, regions see various trajectories. The European Union sees one 
of the largest percentage reductions: its CO2 emissions in 2035 fall to 40% below today’s 
levels (60% below 1990 levels). Emissions in China peak before 2030 and undergo the largest 
absolute reduction, falling 2.1 Gt to 2035. By contrast, emissions in India and Southeast Asia 
increase by around 20% (530 Mt and 440 Mt respectively). On average, per capita emissions 
in advanced economies are currently double those in emerging market and developing 
economies: the differential narrows in the STEPS, but they remain 75% higher in 2035. 
Energy-related methane emissions fall from around 145 Mt today to 115 Mt in 2035, 
reflecting concerted efforts in some countries to reduce the emissions intensity of supply 
and to provide access to clean cooking, together with a 4% reduction in global fossil fuel use. 
Accounting for all greenhouse gases, the long-term global mean temperature rise increases 
from today’s level of around 1.4 degree Celsius (°C) to 1.5 °C by 2030 and reach 2 °C before 
2060. By 2100, the temperature rise is 2.5 °C. (See Chapter 5 for more detail). 
4.3 
Total final consumption 
Global total final consumption – all energy consumed by end-users – was around 450 EJ in 
2024, of which the industry sector accounted for 38%, and the transport and buildings 
sectors for 28% each. The balance between end-use sectors varies by region, in part due to 
differing levels of access to energy services (Figure 4.4). In the STEPS, total final consumption 
rises to over 500 EJ through to 2035, and the balance by sector in each region is broadly 
stable. In advanced economies, each main sector represents close to one-third of the total, 
with the share of industry being the smallest. In emerging market and developing economies, 
by contrast, industry continues to account for the largest portion of total final consumption 
up to 2035, with its share of the total being as much as 60% in China and nearly half in India 
today. In Africa, the buildings sector is responsible today for over half of total final 
consumption, reflecting the lack of access to efficient energy sources faced by many 
households (see Chapter 6). 
Total final consumption per capita is quite stable until 2035 at a global level of around 
56 gigajoules (GJ) per capita, though there are regional differences. While new energy uses 
including AI grow steadily, advanced economies see consumption per capita decline from 
110 GJ per capita to around 105 GJ per capita in 2035, thanks to efficiency improvements, 
notably those that flow from increasing electrification of heating and mobility. Meanwhile, 
emerging market and developing economies see consumption per capita increase from 42 GJ 
per capita today to 45 GJ per capita by 2035, with increasing demand for energy services 
from households acquiring vehicles, air conditioners and other appliances tempered by the 
switch to more efficient energy sources.

Total final consumption remains relatively evenly split across the main end-use sectors in 
advanced economies, while it is dominated by industry in Asia and by buildings in Africa 
Notes: EJ = exajoule; C & S = Central and South America. Other includes agriculture and non-energy use. 
4.3.1 
Transport 
Oil continues to dominate energy use in the transport sector, but this is slowly changing. Its 
share of consumption in the transport sector was over 92% in 2015, but fell to 90% in 2024, 
reflecting the expanding use of electricity, bioenergy and natural gas. 
Electrification plays an important part in reducing the dominance of oil in the STEPS 
(Figure 4.5). By 2035, electricity accounts for 6% of global transport energy demand, and 
some parts of world, e.g. Japan, United States, Canada, China and Europe as a whole, have 
already passed peak oil consumption in their transport sectors. 
Natural gas also gains in importance in transport, particularly in shipping and long-haul 
trucking. In China, policy support and a favourable natural gas price environment encourage 
the adoption of LNG heavy-freight trucks. In India, natural gas car sales expand under similar 
conditions. 
Bioenergy remains a key alternative to oil in transport. The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) limits 
the role it is likely to play in global road transport, but does not end it. Blending mandates 
continue to support bioenergy use in many regions, including Brazil, European Union, India,

Indonesia and the United States. By 2035, bioenergy accounts for around 20-30% of 
transport energy use in Brazil and Indonesia, and close to 10% in the United States and the 
European Union. 
Figure 4.5 ⊳ 
Energy demand in transport by fuel and region in the STEPS, 
2015-2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Fossil fuel demand declines in advanced economies, while its rate of growth slows in 
emerging market and developing economies, levelling off relative to historical trends 
Notes: EJ = exajoule. Hydrogen fuels include hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. 
Trends in energy carriers vary across transport modes, with electrification leading in rail and 
road, while alternative fuels gain ground in shipping and aviation. 
 
Road transport still relies on oil, though electricity meets close to 7% of demand by 2035 
in the STEPS, up from less than 1% today. Increasing electrification means that oil 
demand for road transport peaks in the coming years, even though passenger car 
activity rises by over 30% by 2035 as car ownership expands in emerging market and 
developing economies, and global freight activity increases by a third over the same 
period. 
 
Rail is currently the most electrified transport mode. It is also the most energy efficient 
mode for passenger transportation and the second most efficient mode for freight 
transportation (Box 4.1). Electricity and biofuels currently meet more than 50% of 
energy demand in rail transport, and this rises to 57% by 2035. As a result, oil demand 
falls slightly despite passenger and freight rail activity increasing by over 30% and 15% 
respectively. By 2050, the share of oil in rail transport declines from nearly 50% to 40%, 
while electricity and bioenergy together account for the remaining 60% of rail energy 
demand.

 
Shipping remains heavily dependent on oil, which meets over 90% of its energy demand 
today. This share declines in the coming years, but remains over 80% in 2035. The fuel 
mix continues to diversify through to 2050, even as shipping activity rises around 45%. 
The share of oil in shipping falls to 70% by 2050, while the combined share of natural 
gas and bioenergy rises to over 25%, with methanol, hydrogen and ammonia together 
accounting for a further 3%. Today’s policies support low-emissions fuels covering nearly 
15% of shipping energy demand by 2050. 
 
Aviation remains the most oil-dependent mode over the outlook period, with oil 
accounting for over 95% of energy use in 2035 and 90% in 2050. The share of low-
emissions fuels rises to nearly 5% in 2035 and 10% in 2050, the lowest across all 
transport modes, despite sustainable aviation fuel mandates in the European Union and 
United Kingdom. By 2050, oil use in aviation exceeds 10 mb/d, more than double the 
combined oil use of shipping and rail. 
Box 4.1 ⊳ 
How rail development is reducing oil demand in China 
The rail network in China is highly electrified, with over 70% of non-urban rail activity 
powered by electricity. Therefore, shifting activity to rail from road and aviation transport 
helps reduce oil demand. In China, on average, non-urban passenger rail is around 
80-times less oil intensive per passenger-kilometre than aviation. The equivalent figures 
for passenger cars are nearly 100-times less oil intensive and 10-times for buses. Freight 
rail is around 30-times less oil intensive than road freight.

rail expansion, and non-urban rail activity in the STEPS,

Expansion of non-urban rail transport in China has reduced oil demand,  
avoiding nearly 1.5 mb/d in 2024 – more than the oil saved by EVs worldwide

China leads the world in non-urban passenger rail and freight rail activity, accounting for 
nearly 40% and 30% of global demand respectively. Its high-speed rail (HSR)1 lines have 
doubled since 2015 to over 40 000 kilometres (km) today – almost three-times more than 
the length of HSR lines in the rest of the world combined. Europe has the second-largest 
HSR network, which is one-quarter the size of China’s; Japan and Korea have the next 
largest (UIC, 2025). By 2035, China’s HSR network stretches to around 45 000 km in the 
STEPS. 
In a counterfactual case where non-urban rail activity in China remains at its 2000 level, 
oil demand would be nearly 1.5 mb/d higher in 2024 than it is – a level of avoided demand 
larger than the global oil savings from EVs today (Figure 4.6). Between 2015 and 2024, 
non-urban rail in China has cumulatively avoided almost 12 mb/d of oil demand and over 
1.6 Gt CO2 – equivalent to its annual emissions from transport, buildings and light 
industry combined in 2024.  
How does the future vehicle fleet evolve? 
In 2024, global electric car 2 sales rose by around 25% year-on-year to over 17 million, 
accounting for one-in-five cars sold worldwide. Sales are expected to reach over 20 million 
in 2025, and to account for over one-in-four cars sold worldwide. China alone is on track to 
see the sale of over 14 million electric cars in 2025 – more than the entire world total of 
electric car sales two years ago. Electric car sales in the European Union fell in 2024 following 
subsidy withdrawals in Germany, but the first-half of 2025 shows a nearly 22% year-on-year 
increase, driven by the introduction of around ten new battery electric models priced below 
EUR 25 000 and stricter CO2 emissions standards. In the United States, electric car sales rose 
10% in 2024, though growth slowed to 4% in the first-half of 2025. EV adoption continues to 
rise in emerging market and developing economies, particularly in Viet Nam, Mexico, 
Indonesia, Thailand and Brazil. For instance, the EV market share in Viet Nam exceeds 40%. 
In the STEPS, EVs account for around 50% of sales of all vehicle types by 2035, resulting in 
over 10 mb/d of oil savings. Efficiency improvements in conventional gasoline and diesel 
vehicles reduce oil demand further by around 3.5 mb/d. Additional savings are from the use 
of bioenergy and natural gas as vehicle fuel, which avoid around 0.6 mb/d and 0.8 mb/d 
respectively by 2035. 
Battery prices fell by around 75% between 2015 and 2024, making EVs more cost competitive 
with conventional cars in several key markets (IEA, 2025a). In addition, more affordable 
electric car models are entering the market, particularly in the European Union. Public 
charging infrastructure has expanded too, with more than 1.3 million new charging points 
added in 2024, bringing the global total to more than 5 million.

Global road vehicle fleet by powertrain and vehicle type in

IEA. CC BY 4.0.
The global EV fleet expands more than sixfold by 2035,  
which avoids oil demand of over 10 mb/d that year 
Notes: mb/d = million barrels per day; ICE = internal combustion engine. Light-duty vehicles include passenger 
cars and light commercial vehicles. Heavy trucks include both medium- and heavy-freight trucks. Other 
vehicles include buses and two/three-wheelers. Gasoline and diesel ICE vehicles are fuelled by gasoline, diesel, 
biofuels or synthetic fuels, and include hybrid internal combustion vehicles. Zero-emissions vehicles include 
both electric and fuel cell vehicles. 
These technology trends, supported by fuel economy standards and zero emissions vehicle 
mandates, are increasing the uptake of EVs (Figure 4.7). In the STEPS, the peak year for 
internal combustion engine (ICE) car sales was in 2017, even though the global car fleet goes 
from 1.4 billion today to over 1.6 billion by 2035. By 2050, half of the global light-duty vehicle 
fleet is electric. Sales of electric two/three-wheelers and buses rise to 80% and 45% 
respectively of total sales by 2050. Electric two/three-wheelers are the most affordable entry 
point to electric mobility and require less power to operate: they are especially popular in 
China, India and Southeast Asia (Figure 4.8). Electric urban buses help to improve air quality 
and are being widely adopted: in 2024, nearly all new city buses in China and almost half in 
the European Union were electric.  
Electrification is also reaching vehicle types that traditionally have been challenging to 
progress beyond oil use. In the STEPS by 2050, nearly 25% of the global heavy truck3 fleet is 
electrified, a total of around 25 million vehicles. This growth is led by China, European Union, 
Japan, Korea and United Kingdom. In China, electric heavy trucks are already becoming cost 
competitive thanks to low electricity prices and policy support.  
 
3 Heavy trucks include both medium freight trucks (gross weight 3.5 to 15 tonnes) and heavy-freight trucks 
(gross weight >15 tonnes).

China and European Union lead in the tripling of global electric car sales by 2035,  
while electric two/three-wheelers see a sixfold sales increase in developing economies  
Sources: Historical numbers for electric car sales are based on ACEA (2025); European Commission (2025); 
EV Volumes (2025); Marklines (2025). 
EV sales expansion has major implications for battery demand. By 2035, global EV sales 
battery demand rises to over 5 terawatt-hours (TWh), five-times the level of demand in 2024. 
Announced battery production capacity appears sufficient to meet this rapidly growing 
demand. China dominates both battery demand and manufacturing capacity. Battery 
demand for electric cars alone in China is already larger than the total battery demand of 
advanced economies, including battery storage, yet the share of advanced economies in total 
EV battery demand increases slightly in the long run in the STEPS.  
4.3.2 
Buildings 
Global energy demand in the buildings sector rises in the STEPS at an average of 0.9% per 
year to 2035, a slower rate than the past decade annual average of about 1.0%. Annual coal 
and oil demand in buildings declined in the last decade, and it falls by a further 9% per year 
for coal and 2% per year for oil through to 2035 (Figure 4.9). Natural gas use increased at 
about the same rate as total energy demand in buildings over the last decade: in the STEPS, 
it increases at a slower rate in the short term, flattens out at around 870 bcm at the end of 
the decade, then shifts to a structural decline to 2050. This decline in natural gas demand is 
primarily in advanced economies, where heating demand is curbed by the electrification of 
space heating and efficiency improvements. In emerging market and developing economies, 
natural gas use continues to grow, particularly for cooking and water heating in countries 
such as Brazil, India and Indonesia, where economic growth boosts incomes and policies aim

to expand gas distribution networks. By 2035, more than 700 million people gain access to 
clean cooking technologies, increasing the global access rate to over 80%. As a result, the 
traditional use of biomass declines by over a quarter by 2035.

Electricity use in buildings increases significantly in all economies;  
fossil fuel use declines in advanced economies  
Notes: EJ = exajoule; Other = non-renewable waste and hydrogen; Other renewables = solar thermal and 
geothermal. Buildings sector includes energy consumption for data centres and desalination. 
Electricity use expands more than three-times faster than total building sector energy 
consumption. Electricity demand growth in buildings increases from an annual average of 
2.6% over the past decade to 2.8% per year to 2035. Demand growth is particularly strong in 
emerging market and developing economies, where it rises by over 4% each year, reflecting 
inter alia a 25% increase in residential floorspace and a 70% increase in air conditioner 
ownership. Emerging market and developing economies account for 90% of the global 
ownership expansion of air conditioners, and their space cooling demand increases by more 
than 1 100 TWh in the period to 2035 in the STEPS, which is equivalent to current electricity 
use in the Middle East (Figure 4.10). In advanced economies, electricity demand grows on 
average by 1.3% per year to 2035, driven by the electrification of space heating, growth in 
appliance ownership, demand for information technology services, and the development of 
AI. Data centres account for half of buildings sector electricity demand growth to 2035 in 
advanced economies: in the United States, where data centre expansion is primarily 
concentrated, that share rises to 70%.  
Global heat pump sales rose by 27% from 2020 to 2024. After a sharp increase in 2022, global 
sales declined in 2023 before stabilising in 2024. This was despite a drop in European sales 
in 2024, where the market contracted for two consecutive years following an unprecedented

boom in sales during the 2022 energy crisis and its immediate aftermath. There are now signs 
of renewed growth: we estimate that global sales increased by about 5% in the first-half of 
2025 compared with the same period in 2024. 
Figure 4.10 ⊳ Key residential energy demand drivers by economic grouping in 
the STEPS, 2024-2035 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Over the next ten years, residential floorspace expands by 20% and the number of air 
conditioners units by 50%, mostly in emerging market and developing economies 
Notes: m2 = square metre. Air conditioners of varied sizes are converted to an equivalent number of room air 
conditioning units. Appliances include among others washing machines, dishwashers, dryers, refrigerators, 
televisions and computers. 
In the STEPS, heat pump sales are supported both by their economic competitiveness and by 
continued regulatory support and financial incentives. In the United States and China, air-to-
air units account for most heat pump sales and represent a cost competitive option for both 
space cooling and heating. In the Nordic countries, heat pumps are the most common choice 
for households, often thanks to low electricity prices. Elsewhere, continued regulatory 
support and financial incentives will be important, notably in the parts of the European Union 
with low cooling needs for air-to-water heat pumps. Although Japan is already a mature 
market for heat pumps, their use expands as more building owners opt to use a reverse cycle 
heat pump as their primary heating/cooling equipment. Subsidies for domestic heat pump 
water heaters further support growth in the outlook. 
By 2035 in the STEPS, heat pumps meet almost 40% of space heating demand in Japan and 
the United States, while the share of space heating provided by heat pumps doubles in the 
European Union and China (Figure 4.11). Globally, heat pumps displace around 40 bcm of gas 
in 2035 relative to today, and reduce the energy intensity of heating by up to 8% in major 
heating markets. Despite the positive outlook in the STEPS, heat pump sales remain sensitive 
to consumer confidence and policy stability, as well as economic factors such as the

hinder the uptake of heat pump technologies. 
Figure 4.11 ⊳ Global heat pump sales and contribution to space heating 
demand in selected regions in the STEPS, 2020-2035

Heat pump sales double by 2030 with strong growth in four major markets,  
and meet an increasing share of space heating demand 
Note: GW = gigawatt. 
Meeting mounting cooling needs with more efficient air conditioners  
Space cooling has been one of the fastest growing energy end-uses in the buildings sector 
over the past decade, increasing by around 4% per year, second only to data centres. With 
rising incomes, population growth and a warming climate, this trend continues in the STEPS, 
resulting in an increase of 740 TWh in residential cooling demand by 2035 (Figure 4.12). The 
global distribution of cooling demand shifts significantly towards emerging market and 
developing economies, which account for 80% of residential cooling demand in 2035. 
Demand per capita increases by just over 10% in advanced economies, compared to almost 
60% in emerging market and developing economies. This is primarily due to climatic 
differences, higher current levels of air conditioner ownership in advanced economies, and 
the higher efficiency of cooling systems sold in advanced economies reflective of stronger 
minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for air conditioners. 
Over the past two decades, MEPS for air conditioners have been instituted in nearly all major 
cooling markets. However, the stringency of the standards varies significantly across 
markets. In general, the countries with the highest projected growth in cooling demand are 
also the ones where the least-efficient air conditioners are being sold today. If all countries 
with established MEPS for air conditioners were to raise their standards to match those in 
Japan, global cooling demand would be 25% lower in 2035 than the 2 100 TWh projected in 
the STEPS.

efficiencies reflect operation under local climate conditions. 
Box 4.2 ⊳ 
Floorspace doubles but building codes restrain demand growth 
Floorspace in buildings worldwide has increased from 150 billion square metres (m2) in 
2000 to 270 billion m2 in 2024. Continuing urbanisation and economic development 
mean that it is set to reach 300 billion m2 by 2030. The number of countries with 
mandatory energy-related building energy codes was 25 in 2000 and extended to 85 in 
2025. Current energy-related building codes save around 10 EJ annually compared to a 
baseline without codes, primarily by reducing heating demand in advanced economies 
and China (Figure 4.13). 
In some emerging market and developing economies where cooling needs are significant, 
the estimated energy savings linked to building codes are limited by enforcement and 
compliance challenges. In Central and South American countries with mandatory building 
codes, for example, less than half of all new construction meets energy performance 
standards. An assessment of compliance and enforcement policies in 29 emerging 
market and developing economies shows that only 11 countries have implemented the 
steps necessary to enforce building codes (World Bank, 2025). Reflecting these 
shortcomings, the stock of non-compliant floorspace stays steady between 2024 and 
2050 in the STEPS, even though building codes having been established in all of the 
largest construction markets. In the coming decades, building codes nevertheless play a 
growing role to restrain additional energy demand for cooling.

Industry 
In the STEPS, energy demand in the industry sector increases by an average 1.2% per year to 
2035 as a shift takes place from relatively energy-intensive industries4 to higher value-added 
manufacturing. This rate marks a slowdown compared with the last decade, during which 
energy demand in industry was up by an average of 1.5% per year and contributed 40% to 
the overall increase in global total final consumption. 
Today, non-energy-intensive industries account for less than a third of industrial energy 
demand and generate around two-thirds of industrial value added. In the STEPS, those 
industries increase production rapidly and are responsible for over half of energy demand 
growth to 2035. Energy-intensive industries experience less rapid increases. Steel and 
cement production rise by 1% and 0.6% respectively per year to 2035 (Figure 4.14), reflecting 
weaker domestic demand in China and advanced economies, while primary chemicals 
production, e.g. ammonia, methanol and high-value chemicals, and aluminium production 
both increase by around 2% per year as they substitute for other materials and respond to 
new demands, including those arising from the production of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels 
and EVs.

Figure 4.14 ⊳ Industry value added and production by sub-sector in the STEPS, 
2024-2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Chemicals and aluminium production are the main drivers of energy-intensive industry 
growth, while light industries see the fastest growth and boost industry value added 
Note: PPP = purchasing power parity; Gt = gigatonnes. 
Growth in industrial production is largely concentrated in emerging market and developing 
economies, where energy consumption in industry is almost three-times higher than in 
advanced economies. In large part, this reflects China’s role as a global industrial centre, 
robust manufacturing industries in India and Southeast Asia, and the petrochemical industry 
in the Middle East. By 2035, almost all energy consumption growth takes place in emerging 
market and developing economies, with China accounting for around one-quarter of the 
total (Figure 4.15). In advanced economies, despite economic recovery and policy measures 
that support domestic production, energy consumption in industry does not increase 
significantly, with efficiency gains almost outweighing limited expansion of growth in 
industrial production.  
Coal demand in industry falls 6%, primarily due to slow growth and substitutions in coal-
intensive sub-sectors, mainly steel and cement. Scrap use for steel production increases with 
policy support, and new plants capitalise on higher scrap availability. New plants to produce 
iron often use natural gas instead of coal-fired blast furnaces, which cuts their share in iron 
production from 90% today to 84% in 2035 in the STEPS. The share of energy-intensive clinker 
used for the production of cement falls from 0.72 today to 0.71 in 2035 as clinker is partially 
substituted by other materials. Meanwhile, cement production shifts from China to other 
emerging market and developing economies where the average share of coal in the 
production process is around 40%, well below the 70% share in China. 
Industry sector energy demand for all fuels except coal expands until 2035. Non-energy-
intensive industries and chemicals drive growth in electricity demand, which rises at an 
annual average of 2.1% to 2035, outpacing the growth in demand for other fuels. Natural gas

demand increases by an average 1.4% per year to almost 1 100 bcm by 2035, continuing its 
trend both in markets with domestic resources, e.g. Middle East and United States, and in 
importing regions such as China, India and Southeast Asia. Despite increases in the United 
States, natural gas demand in industry peaks in advanced economies by 2030, mostly due to 
the expanding electrification of industry in the European Union as part of measures like the 
Clean Industrial Deal. Oil demand in industry rises by around 1.6% per year to 24 mb/d by 
2035, with almost 90% of the increase reflecting increased demand for plastics, even though 
the recycling collection rate is up from 19% in 2024 to 24% in 2035.    
Figure 4.15 ⊳ Energy demand in industry by economic grouping and fuel in 
the STEPS, 2015-2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
 Emerging market and developing economies drive industrial energy demand growth; 
electrification in industry increases in virtually all economies  
Notes: EJ = exajoule. Other includes geothermal, solar thermal, hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels. Where 
low-emissions hydrogen is produced and consumed onsite at an industrial facility, the fuel input, such as 
electricity or natural gas, is reported as total final consumption, not the hydrogen output. 
Structural shifts, improved material use and technical energy efficiency temper energy 
demand growth in industry 
Although demand for industrial products continues to increase, the associated energy 
demand grows more slowly in the STEPS than it has over the last decade. Industrial intensity 
– measured as the energy per unit of value added by industry – improves at a rate of 1.6% 
per year until 2035, faster than the average rate of 1.1% since 2015 and notably faster than 
the rate since 2021 of 0.8%. Three key factors are at play. 
 
Structural shifts occur from energy-intensive to non-energy-intensive industries, which 
need less energy to add value to the economy. One unit of energy consumed by non-
energy-intensive industries adds an average of almost ten-times as much monetary 
value as one consumed by energy-intensive industries. This structural shift has been

underway since 2014, led by China (see Chapter 3, Box 3.1). If the global proportion of 
energy-intensive industries in industrial value added and their structure remained static 
from today to 2035, energy demand in industry would be about 37 EJ (19%) higher than 
in the STEPS (Figure 4.16). 
 
Technical efficiency improvements are driven both by policies – such as MEPS for 
motors, energy audits and funding support – and by cost-effective technological 
improvements. Over-capacity in some sectors and regions drives competition and 
stimulates improvements, while new plant additions are more efficient than existing 
facilities. Taken together, technical efficiency measures avoid about 5 EJ of energy 
demand in industry in 2035. 
 
More efficient use of input materials reduces energy-intensive industry demand. In 
steel, electric arc furnaces use up to ten-times less energy than production in the blast 
furnaces that currently dominate production (IEA, 2020), with the exact savings 
dependent on the share of recycled scrap used. Clinker substitution cuts thermal energy 
demand in the production of cement, reducing energy demand per tonne by a factor of 
eight compared to conventional production. Improvements in material efficiency 
accelerate compared to historic rates, supported by policies in China and India for steel 
scrap use, targets for plastic recycling, and the availability of more materials reaching 
the end of their lifetime and being available for recycling. In the absence of these 
improvements, energy demand in 2035 would be around 5 EJ higher than in the STEPS. 
Figure 4.16 ⊳ Avoided energy demand from efficiency improvements in 
industry in the STEPS to 2035

Structural shifts reduce energy demand by 19%; improved technical efficiency and 
material savings temper growth in energy-intensive industry more than in the past  
Notes: EIT = energy-intensive industry; OTH = other industry. Savings in 2024 and 2035 are calculated using 
the baselines of 2015 and 2024 respectively. Savings from structural shifts assume no change in the

What is driving the Age of Electricity in the industry sector? 
As in other end-use sectors, electricity demand growth in the industry sector is contributing 
to the Age of Electricity. The industry sector adds around 260 TWh per year to its current 
demand for electricity through to 2035, which is roughly as much as electricity demand today 
in Spain. Some of this growth in demand, nearly 15%, reflects the use of new electric 
technologies in industry, but most of it, around 85%, stems from activity growth and 
structural shifts to non-energy-intensive industries. These industries use a higher share of 
mechanical energy and require thermal energy at lower temperatures, making them easier 
to electrify, and they account for three-quarters, 2 100 TWh, of industry electricity demand 
growth by 2035. 
In the machinery sub-sector, much of the increase in electricity demand reflects higher 
production rather than more electrification. Machinery has the highest share of 
electrification and the highest demand growth of all industry sub-sectors, with electricity 
demand increasing 50% by 2035 while the share of electrification only increases by two 
percentage points (Figure 4.17). However, there is scope for further electrification even in 
the machinery sub-sector: while its electrification rates are already over 70% in China, Japan 
and Korea, they are lower elsewhere, including in Europe at 55% and the United States at 
60%. 
Figure 4.17 ⊳ Electricity demand and share of electrification for selected 
industrial sub-sectors in the STEPS, 2015-2035 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Electricity demand growth is driven by activity growth in most sub-sectors, and  
by structural shifts towards non-energy-intensive sectors amenable to electrification  
Measures to improve the use of materials tend to replace thermal energy demand with 
electrical alternatives, e.g. mechanical recycling for plastics instead of steam crackers; arc 
furnaces for steel scrap instead of blast furnaces, which have significant impact in some 
regions. In India, electricity use in the chemicals sub-sector more than doubles by 2035, while

its total energy demand increases by less than 50%. In China, the share of electricity in the 
steel sub-sector increases by five percentage points. As conventional energy-intensive routes 
remain dominant, the global effect of these shifts is limited, but it increases the share of 
electricity in steel production by three percentage points by 2035 in the STEPS. 
Policies to support industry electrification also have an impact, such as the EU Clean 
Industrial Deal (see Chapter 8, Section 8.4), carbon contracts-for-difference in various 
countries, and support for industrial heat pumps in China. The share of electricity in non-
energy-intensive industries increases by four percentage points in the European Union and 
seven percentage points in China by 2035. However, electricity demand growth has 
implications for infrastructure, with factories requiring new grid access or increased 
connection capacity, and for the provision of flexibility to unlock the opportunities from 
electrification.

Demand 
Global electricity demand increased by close to 3% annually in recent years, and this rose to 
over 4% in 2024. China has been the dominant driver of growth in electricity demand, 
accounting for nearly two-thirds of the increase since 2015. Other regions, including India, 
the Middle East, and parts of Southeast Asia, have seen demand rise sharply, reflecting both 
rising economic activity and structural shifts towards increased electrification.

The annual growth in electricity demand of close to 3% per year over the last decade is nearly 
twice the rate of growth for total energy demand (Figure 4.18). Between 2024 and 2035, 
global demand for electricity is projected to increase at over four-times the rate of total 
energy demand in the STEPS. In some advanced economies, such as the European Union and 
Japan, electricity demand has declined in recent years, though this trend is expected to 
reverse in the Outlook period. 
Emerging market and developing economies account for around three-quarters of the 
additional global electricity demand by 2035 in the STEPS. China alone is responsible for 40% 
of this growth, maintaining its position as the world’s largest electricity consumer. India also 
sees demand rise rapidly, with electricity demand reaching around 5 000 TWh by 2050 on 
the back of sustained growth of over 4% per year between 2024 and 2050 in the STEPS.

Electricity demand increases by nearly 1 000 TWh each year,  
mostly driven by industry, appliances, cooling and EVs 
Notes: TWh = terawatt-hours. Other buildings include electric space and water heating excluding heat pumps, 
lighting, cooking, desalination and data centres. Other includes agriculture, non-road transport and other 
energy sector excluding hydrogen production. 
One of the main reasons behind the strong rise in electricity demand in emerging market and 
developing economies is their relatively low level of electricity consumption per capita. 
Today, electricity demand per capita averages around 2 600 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year 
in emerging market and developing economies, which is approximately three-times less than 
the average in advanced economies. However, this gap is gradually narrowing: by 2035, 
electricity demand per capita in emerging market and developing economies is projected to 
be 2.5-times lower than in advanced economies. This narrowing of the gap reflects a number

of changes in emerging market and developing economies, including rising income levels, 
more access to electricity, increasing use of electric appliances, and the continuing 
electrification of the industry and transport sectors. 
Global electricity demand increases by nearly 1 000 TWh per year through to 2035 – 
equivalent to adding the electricity demand of all advanced economies combined over the 
next decade (Figure 4.19). This surge reflects rising demand for appliances and cooling 
systems, rising levels of production in the electrified industrial sector, and the accelerating 
pace of electrification in the transport sector. Industrial electricity use remains a major 
driver, accounting for roughly 30% of the growth, closely followed by rising demand from 
appliances and cooling. In addition, the scaling-up of hydrogen production via electrolysis 
adds around 400 TWh to the total by 2035, equal to around 1.5% of current global electricity 
demand. This scaling-up is driven by various policy instruments: such as grants and quotas in 
the European Union; auctions in India, Japan and Korea; tax incentives as in Brazil; or 
contracts-for-differences as in Germany and Japan. 
Box 4.3 ⊳ 
Demand response: unlocking flexibility in the Age of Electricity 
Electricity demand growth around the world in part is driven by the increasing use of 
technologies that can consume electricity flexibly, such as EVs and smart air conditioners. 
With the right regulatory and technical frameworks in place, these assets can provide 
demand response – the capacity to shift or reduce electricity use during peak periods – 
and offer valuable flexibility, serving as a fast and cost-effective buffer when supply is 
tight. Today, we estimate that around 100 gigawatts (GW) of demand response exists 
globally, primarily in the industrial sector and in countries like the United States with 
established programmes. Demand response is expanding rapidly in other countries and 
regions such as the United Kingdom and the European Union where regulation supports 
participation by the buildings and transport sectors, notably via aggregators and dynamic 
retail tariffs. In the STEPS, demand response activation, i.e. demand response capacity 
that is actually used, grows more than threefold by 2035, driven by higher participation 
from the buildings and transport sectors through smart air conditioners, heat pumps and 
EVs (Figure 4.20). Data centres can also provide flexibility through thermal storage, 
workload shifting or backup power, but high capital costs, regulatory constraints, and the 
need to maintain high information technology reliability limit how much their power use 
can be adjusted without risking service disruption. 
The nature of demand response is also set to evolve. It is mainly activated today during 
peak demand periods, triggered dynamically by system operators. By 2035, in the STEPS, 
flexibility is mobilised daily in response to predictable price signals to shift consumption 
away from evening peaks to cheaper, low-demand periods earlier in the day 
(Figure 4.20). With the adoption of time-of-use tariffs and smart equipment, this form of 
routine flexibility, especially from heating, cooling and transport, accounts for most of 
the energy shifted across the year in the STEPS. However, targeted response remains

critical: at peak times, industrial demand response continues to deliver a significant share 
of the flexible capacity. Together, these layers of flexibility strengthen system resilience 
and can reduce the need for peaking capacity, as discussed in Chapter 5. 
Figure 4.20 ⊳ Demand response activation by sector and contribution to 
daily and peak activation in the STEPS, 2024 and 2035 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Demand response increases more than threefold by 2035,  
and all sectors support both daily load shifting and peak management 
  
The drivers of electricity demand vary substantially across countries and regions. In advanced 
economies, EV adoption is the largest contributor, responsible for over 30% of additional 
electricity demand by 2035 in the STEPS. Demand from data centres – driven by increases in 
digitalisation and AI – is the second-largest by 2035, followed by electricity-intensive 
industries, appliances and air conditioning. In contrast, the buildings sector leads demand 
growth to 2035 in emerging market and developing economies. Rising levels of ownership of 
household appliances and increasing demand for cooling are major contributors, together 
with electrification in industry, notably in China, India and Southeast Asia. 
In the STEPS, electricity accounts for over one-quarter of total final consumption by 2035, up 
from 21% in 2024. Electric technologies are much more efficient than others, for example, 
electric cars are two-to-four-times more efficient than fossil fuel alternatives, and heat 
pumps are around three-to-five-times more efficient. This means that contribution of 
electricity to useful energy delivered to end-users is more substantial than its share of total 
final consumption would suggest, and in fact it provides approximately 40% of useful energy 
to end-users by 2035 (Figure 4.21).  
Some applications remain difficult or costly to electrify with current mature technologies. In 
energy-intensive industries, almost two-thirds of all energy use is to produce high-

temperature heat above 400 °C, and production processes depend on specific materials, so 
tailored technologies need to be developed to electrify the processes involved either directly 
or through the use of electrolytic hydrogen (see Chapter 7, Box 7.5). In the transport sector, 
limitations in battery energy density make it difficult to electrify aviation and shipping, which 
together represent around 25% of non-electric transport energy demand in 2035.

Electricity generation 
The global electricity mix continues its structural transformation in the STEPS, albeit at a pace 
largely consistent with recent trends. In this scenario, policy targets are assumed to be 
extended and modestly scaled up beyond their current timelines, while carbon pricing sees 
significant but measured increases. Continued efforts to deploy energy storage, reform 
power markets and streamline permitting processes support steady growth in solar PV and 
wind power deployment in most regions. Over the past five years, annual capacity additions 
of solar PV and wind have increased by around 25% per year, and the markets for these 
technologies expand in the STEPS by another 25% to 2035, with annual capacity additions of 
around 820 GW. The expansion of solar PV and wind power in the STEPS is underpinned by 
the continued presence of supportive policy frameworks, improvements in power system 
operations, investment to modernise and expand grids, and more use of distributed energy 
resources to help reduce curtailment and enhance grid flexibility. 
In the STEPS, global coal-fired power generation continues to expand in the near term, 
remaining the largest source of electricity until the early 2030s (Figure 4.22). It then begins a

steady decline which reflects the commitment that more than 55 countries have made to 
phase out its unabated use. By 2035, coal-fired generation is around 20% below today’s level, 
and is no longer the dominant source of electricity. By 2050, it falls to nearly 60% below its 
current level, though it remains a significant part of the mix in many emerging market and 
developing economies. Natural gas maintains a central role in the electricity generation mix: 
its use increases by over 15% to 2035 before gradually decreasing, and it continues to provide 
critical system flexibility and backup capacity. Oil-fired generation declines steadily as 
countries, including those in the Middle East, transition to alternative sources. Nuclear power 
experiences a notable resurgence, with output rising by nearly 40% by 2035 and by a further 
40% by 2050, supported by policy commitments in more than 40 countries.

Expansion of solar PV, wind and nuclear curb coal-fired power  
and reshape the global electricity generation mix 
Note: TWh = terawatt-hours; CCUS = carbon capture, utilisation and storage. Other renewables include 
bioenergy and renewable waste, concentrating solar power, geothermal and marine. Other includes oil, 
non-renewable waste and other sources. 
As a result of these trends, the global electricity generation mix undergoes a major 
transformation in the STEPS. The share of fossil fuels declines rapidly from 60% in 2024 to 
less than 40% by 2035 and just 20% by 2050, and the share of low-emissions sources rises 
sharply. Renewables, which currently account for about one-third of global electricity 
generation, expand to deliver over half by 2035 and more than two-thirds by 2050. Solar PV 
and wind are the main contributors, with their combined share of generation increasing from 
15% today to 40% in 2035 and 55% in 2050. Nuclear power maintains a share of just under 
10% throughout the period. 
In advanced economies, low-emissions power generation rises 50% faster than electricity 
demand to 2035, with wind and solar PV outpacing total demand growth on their own

(Figure 4.23). While fossil fuel generation declines significantly – coal use falls 60% by 2035 
and natural gas use by 5% – natural gas remains the single largest electricity source through 
to 2035. Nuclear energy meets almost 10% of demand growth to 2035, with its role 
expanding as a result of uprates at existing reactors, new construction and reactor restarts, 
particularly in the United States, France and Japan.

In emerging market and developing economies, electricity demand increases by 50% through 
to 2035 in the STEPS, but low-emissions sources expand faster, increasing by over 
10 500 TWh between 2024 and 2035. China alone accounts for two-thirds of this increase: 
the rapid growth in its low-emissions generation keeps pace with its rising electricity needs. 
Solar PV meets 60% of demand growth in emerging market and developing economies. Wind, 
hydropower and nuclear also contribute, with nuclear generation in emerging market and 
developing economies doubling by 2035. Gas-fired power also increases significantly, and 
coal remains the largest source of electricity across emerging market and developing 
economies in 2035, although it declines over the period. 
In the STEPS, the global share of low-emissions electricity rises from 40% in 2024 to over 60% 
by 2035, driven by supportive policies, maturing supply chains and improving cost 
competitiveness (Box 4.4). By 2024, 143 countries had established targets to promote 
expansion of renewable electricity (REN21, 2025), which sets the background for policy

support. Most regions see the share of low-emissions sources in electricity rise to over 50% 
by 2035, with notable exceptions in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, though both regions 
make substantial progress (Figure 4.24). The European Union sees large contributions from 
nuclear, wind and solar PV, while Central and South America benefits as the region with the 
world’s highest share of hydropower. The most significant gains in low-emissions shares – 
over 25 percentage points – are in Australia, India, China, Africa, Japan and Korea.

Low-emissions sources take a larger share of the electricity mix in all regions with  
renewables leading the way underpinned by low costs and widespread policy support  
Notes: C & S America = Central and South America. CCUS = carbon capture, utilisation and storage. Other 
renewables include bioenergy and renewable waste, concentrating solar power, geothermal and marine. 
Solar PV expands rapidly in most markets, supplying one-quarter or more of total electricity 
generation in Australia, China, India and the European Union in 2035, and making swift 
progress in Africa and the Middle East. Both onshore and offshore wind also expand rapidly, 
notably in Europe. Hydropower continues to play a central role in Central and South America, 
Africa and Southeast Asia, though the output from many individual projects is expected to 
decline as average temperatures increase. Geothermal energy remains a small part of the 
electricity mix to 2035, though innovation is expanding its potential (IEA, 2024). Meanwhile, 
low-emissions hydrogen and ammonia begin to gain traction in power generation in the form 
of hydrogen blended with natural gas and ammonia co-fired with coal particularly in Japan 
and Korea. 
Nuclear power is experiencing a resurgence, with over 40 countries now pursuing policies to 
expand its role in the electricity generation mix. Investment is rising, 2025 is set to mark a 
record year for global nuclear power generation, and innovation in small modular reactors is
