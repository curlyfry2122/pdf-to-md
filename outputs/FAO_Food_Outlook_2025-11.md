Fertilizer market developments
Focus on olive oil
Fertilizer production rebounded in 2024 and 2025, led by nitrogen 
and potassium, while prices rose amid high energy costs but remained 
below the 2022 peaks. Global trade has stabilized, and short-term 
supply looks adequate, though policy developments and affordability will 
shape future trends.
International olive oil prices declined significantly from their early 2024 peak 
following strong supply recovery in the 2024/25 season. As for 2025/26, 
tentative forecasts point to year on year stable olive oil production, 
while global consumption and trade are expected to keep expanding. 
Nevertheless, the sector still faces numerous challenges. 
Special features
Highlights
Global coarse grain supplies are expected to 
remain ample in 2025/26, underpinned by record 
maize harvests in Brazil and the United States of 
America. Feed use of coarse grains is forecast to 
reach a new high amid stable market conditions, 
while maize, barley, and sorghum stocks will likely 
stay comfortably high into early 2026.
Coarse grains
International sugar markets are anticipated 
to shift toward a production surplus in 
the 2025/26 (October/September) season, 
largely reflecting expectations of higher 
global output and only modest growth in 
world consumption. Favourable weather 
conditions and expanded cultivated areas 
are set to drive record harvests. 
Sugar
Global meat production is forecast to rise in 
2025, led by growth in poultry meat output 
supported by lower feed costs, partly offset by 
a decline in bovine meat output due to limited 
cattle inventories. Strong import demand, 
in particular for bovine meat, is expected to 
support trade and keep prices elevated.
Meat
Global wheat production is expected to reach a 
new high in 2025, with utilization and stocks also 
forecast at record levels in the 2025/26 season. 
Trade will likely rebound from the subdued level 
of 2024/25, with importing countries taking 
advantage of low prices amid ample supplies in 
major exporting countries.
Wheat
Global fisheries and aquaculture production 
is projected to grow by 1.7 percent in 2025, 
reaching 197 million tonnes. Trade volumes 
continue to expand, although supplies from 
certain capture fisheries declined. Index prices 
for capture fisheries rose sharply in 2025, while 
aquaculture declined before recovering. 
Fisheries
Global milk production is forecast to rise in 
2025, led by continued growth in Asia and 
higher output in the Americas. However, 
global dairy trade is predicted to contract, as 
high prices and improved domestic supplies 
are anticipated to curb import demand. 
International dairy prices remain elevated, 
despite recent declines.
Dairy
Although world rice utilization is forecast 
to grow robustly in 2025/26, it may 
still fall short of the expected global 
bumper harvest. As a result, world rice 
reserves could continue rising to reach 
unprecedented highs. 
Rice
International olive oil prices have declined 
significantly from their early 2024 peak 
following strong supply recovery in the 2024/25 
season. For 2025/26, preliminary forecasts 
point to year-on-year stable olive oil production, 
while global consumption and trade are 
expected to keep expanding. Nevertheless, the 
sector still faces numerous challenges. 
Oilcrops
A
gricultural markets are inherently 
sensitive to weather fluctuations. 
The latest FAO assessments point 
to broad-based increases in food commodity 
production, 
accompanied 
by 
strong 
consumption growth, supporting recovery 
of inventories. However, the trade outlook 
remains clouded by an evolving global trade 
environment and ongoing policy uncertainties.

Forecast at 2 990 million tonnes, world cereal production 
(including rice in milled equivalent) is expected to reach a 
record level in 2025, up 4.4 percent from 2024. Outputs of all 
major cereals are anticipated to rise, with the largest year on 
year increase forecast for maize and the smallest for rice. Both 
maize and rice outputs are predicted to hit new record highs. 
World cereal utilization in 2025/26 is forecast at 
2 929 million tonnes, up 51.9 million tonnes or 1.8 percent 
from 2024/25. The growth is expected to result mainly 
from ample supplies and lower prices. Feed use of cereals is 
expected to rise by 2.1 percent, with major producers such 
as Brazil and the United States of America directing more 
maize to animal rations, while in Asia, strong demand from 
aquaculture is expected to be met though imports of feed-
quality wheat. Other uses of cereals, particularly maize, are 
also set to increase. Human consumption of cereals is forecast 
to rise marginally, reflecting population growth and gradual 
dietary shifts. 
Based on the current forecasts for global cereal 
production in 2025, stocks could rise by 5.7 percent from 
their opening levels to a record high of 916.3 million tonnes. 
Global maize inventories are expected to expand the most, 
especially in Northern America, followed by wheat and barley, 
while global sorghum stocks may decrease slightly. World rice 
stocks at the close of the 2025/26 marketing year are forecast 
to rise by 2.2 percent to a new peak of 215.4 million tonnes. 
Overall, the global cereal stocks-to-use ratio in 2025/26 is 
predicted to rise to 31.1 percent, the highest level since 
2017/18.  
World trade in cereals in the 2025/26 season is 
anticipated to expand by 3.2 percent to 499.5 million tonnes. 
Wheat trade (July/June) is expected to rise by 9.9 million 
tonnes, or 5.1 percent from the previous season, driven 
largely by Asian imports, which are forecast to increase 
by 15.6 million tonnes. Global trade in coarse grains is 
anticipated to expand amid relatively low export prices and 
stronger demand for animal protein, though traded volumes 
will likely remain below the 2023/24 peak. By contrast, global 
rice trade is forecast to decline by 1.2 percent to 61.1 million 
tonnes in 2026.
In October 2025, the FAO Cereal Price Index 
averaged 103.6 points, down 9.5 percent from a year 
earlier and 40.3 percent below its peak reached in May 
2022. The decline was led by international rice prices, 
with the FAO All Rice Price Index down 21.7 percent 
year on year. Wheat, maize and sorghum price indices 
also declined, while the barley index remained slightly 
above its October 2024 level.

Global wheat production in 2025 is forecast to rise 
by 2.5 percent year on year to a record level of 819 
million tonnes. The increase is largely driven by an 
anticipated sharp rebound in the European Union, 
reflecting higher yields due to favourable weather and 
expanded plantings. A sizeable production increase was 
also recorded in India, supported by extensive plantings 
incentivized by remunerative prices, and in the Russian 
Federation, where conducive weather boosted yields, 
particularly for spring wheat. These gains more than 
offset expected declines in several Asia countries, where 
widespread and substantial rainfall deficits reduced 
outputs in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kazakhstan, 
Pakistan, and Türkiye. 
Total wheat utilization in 2025/26 is forecast at 808.3 
million tonnes, up 7.7 million tonnes (1.0 percent) from 
2024/25, driven by expectations of higher uses for both 
food and feed. Wheat food use is expected to rise by 3.4 
million tonnes (0.6 percent), although globally, per capita 
consumption may fall slightly as population growth is 
concentrated in regions with lower wheat consumption 
levels. While primarily a food crop, wheat use in animal 
feed is expected to increase in Asia and Northern 
America in the current season. 
World wheat trade in 2025/26 (July/June) is forecast 
to recover from its 2024/25 subdued level, rising by 9.9 
million tonnes, or 5.1 percent, to 202.5 million tonnes, 
a level above the past five-year average but still well 
below the 2023/24 peak. Abundant exportable supplies 
are expected in major exporters, including Australia, 
Argentina, the European Union, the Russian Federation, 
and the United States of America. Although demand 
from China is likely to remain subdued, other traditional 
importers such as Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Syrian 
Arab Republic are expected to take advantage of the 
ample supply situation, while Türkiye’s imports are set to 
rebound after the expiry of its import ban in March 2025.
Global wheat inventories are predicted to rise above 
their opening levels by 3.6 percent, reaching a record 
level of 328.8 million tonnes by the end of the season 
in 2026. Several major producers, including China and 
India, are expected to close the season with plentiful 
reserves. As a result, the global wheat stocks-to-use ratio 
is forecast to rise to 40.4 percent in 2025/26, indicating 
a generally comfortable global supply situation. Ample 
availabilities and strong competition among exporters 
have driven in recent months a general downward trend 
in international wheat prices, which in October 2025 
averaged 6.3 percent below their level a year ago.

FOOD OUTLOOK
NOVEMBER 2025
Global coarse grain production in 2025 is forecast at  
1 614 million tonnes, marking a 6.6 percent increase 
from last year and a new record high. Most of this growth 
reflects anticipated large maize harvests in Brazil and 
the United States of America, primarily driven by price-
induced area expansions. Notable increases in maize 
production were also registered across most countries 
in Southern Africa, where ample and well-distributed 
rains led to strong yield recoveries. These increases are 
expected to more than offset maize production declines in 
Argentina and several Asian countries where dry-weather 
conditions curbed yields. 
Total utilization of coarse grains in 2025/26 is forecast 
to rise by 32.4 million tonnes, or 2.1 percent, to a record 
level of 1 574 million tonnes. The increase is driven 
predominantly by anticipated growth in the use of maize 
for both feed and industrial purposes, as buyers continue 
to capitalize on ample supplies and low prices. Global 
utilization of barley in 2025/26 is set to rise by just under 
1.0 million tonnes, or 0.7 percent, while that of sorghum 
could grow by 2.4 million tonnes, or 3.8 percent, mostly 
for animal feed in Brazil and China. 
In the 2025/26 marketing year (July/June), 
international trade in coarse grains is forecast to grow 
by 6.1 million tonnes, or 2.6 percent, mainly reflecting 
an anticipated rebound in sorghum trade. China is 
expected to remain the world’s leading importer of 
sorghum, while both Argentina and Brazil are set to 
expand their role in the sorghum export market. Trade in 
both maize and barley is also expected to recover from 
the previous season and reach the average levels of the 
past five seasons, with ample exportable supplies offering 
importers a wider choice of origins in 2025/26.
After falling to an eleven-year low in 2024/25, global 
coarse grain inventories are predicted to rebound strongly 
in 2025/26, due primarily to an anticipated recovery in 
maize stocks. Most of the expansion in maize inventories 
is anticipated in the United States of America, along with 
smaller increases in other exporting countries, including 
Brazil and Ukraine. Barley stocks are also expected to 
rebound in 2025/26, particularly in the European Union 
after a recovery in production, while sorghum stocks 
will likely contract slightly. Overall, both the world 
stocks-to-use ratio and the major exporters’ stocks-to-
disappearance ratio (in which “disappearance” is defined 
as domestic consumption plus exports) for coarse grains 
are expected to rise, with the latter climbing to 12.9 
percent, exceeding the average level of the last five 
seasons.

Food Outlook 
November 2025
The 2025/26 season is on track to see another 
record global harvest of close to 556.4 million tonnes 
(milled basis), up 1.2 percent from 2024/25. In Asia, 
production is set to surpass last season’s all-time high, 
underpinned by continued area expansions and, 
with some exceptions, generally favourable weather 
conditions. Similarly, Latin America and the Caribbean 
is poised to harvest its largest crop on record. These 
gains could overshadow weaker results elsewhere, as 
reduced producer margins are set to depress production 
in Europe, Northern America, and Oceania, while erratic 
rains curb output in Africa.
Although rising food consumption and continued 
efforts to divert excess supplies to non-food uses may 
keep world rice utilization robust in 2025/26, at a 
forecast 551.8 million tonnes, it could still fall short of 
global production. As a result, world rice stocks at the 
close of 2025/26 marketing year may rise by another 
2.2 percent to a new high of 215.4 million tonnes. 
Stock accumulations in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, 
India, Thailand, and Viet Nam are forecast to drive this 
expansion, outweighing anticipated drawdowns namely 
in Indonesia, Madagascar, and the Philippines.
International rice trade regained momentum in 2024 
and 2025, amid abundant exportable availabilities, 
reduced stockpiles in importing countries, and the 
repeal of India’s export restrictions. However, with 
several traditional importing countries expected to rely 
on sufficient supplies at hand to meet consumption 
needs and/or stabilize consumer prices, world rice trade 
in 2026 (January-December) is predicted to subside by 
1.1 percent year on year to 61.1 million tonnes. Apart 
from Brazil, India, Uruguay, and Viet Nam, most rice 
exporting countries are expected to see their shipments 
stagnate or decline in 2026, constrained by weaker 
demand in their traditional markets and/or a reduced 
competitive edge.
Large exportable supplies have fuelled intense 
competition among exporters, driving international 
rice prices down continuously since May. In the Indica 
segment, Indonesia’s continued absence from the 
market and the Philippines’ September imposition of 
restrictions on non-specialty rice imports have tended 
to exacerbate the downward price pressure exerted by 
the supply glut. As a result, the FAO All Rice Price Index 
(FARPI) averaged to 98.4 points in October 2025. At that 
level, the FARPI stood 7.5 percent below its May value 
and its lowest level since December 2021.

Food Outlook 
November 2025 
Preliminary forecasts for the 2025/26 (October/
September) marketing season point to continued 
expansion in global oilseed production, underpinned 
by larger harvests of rapeseed, soybean, and sunflower 
seed, which are expected to more than offset likely 
declines in cottonseed and groundnut outputs. The 
anticipated growth in global soybean production is 
primarily driven by expectations of a record harvest 
in Brazil, assuming normal weather conditions in 
the months ahead. By contrast, soybean outputs 
in Argentina, India, Ukraine, and the United States 
of America are expected to decline, mostly due to 
contraction in planting areas. Global rapeseed output 
is forecast to rebound in 2025/26, driven by generally 
favourable growing conditions across Australia, 
Canada, and the European Union, outweighing an 
expected smaller crop in Ukraine. As for sunflower seed, 
global production is anticipated to recover partially, 
underpinned by area expansions in Argentina and the 
Russian Federation, while production in the European 
Union is set to increase on account of higher yields. 
World palm oil output is forecast to increase marginally 
following last season’s strong rebound, driven by a tepid 
growth in mature oil palm areas in Indonesia. 
Global utilization of oils/fats in 2025/26 is forecast 
to expand by 2.1 percent from the previous season, 
largely driven by expectations of higher demand from 
the biofuel sector amid supportive policies across several 
major consuming countries. As global vegetable oil 
consumption is expected to outpace production, world 
carry-over inventories of oils/fats are forecast to decline 
for a third consecutive season in 2025/26. For meals/
cakes, global consumption is tentatively forecast to 
grow by 3.2 percent, reflecting expectations of a modest 
increase in world production, while oilmeal stocks will 
likely continue accumulating, reaching new record highs. 
International trade in vegetable oils is expected to 
increase, fuelled by higher import requirements – mainly 
in Asia – to replenish stocks, which will be met by 
anticipated higher export availabilities. Meanwhile, after 
two consecutive seasons of strong growth, international 
trade in oilmeals is predicted to expand at a below 
average rate of 1.1 percent. 
Reflecting these market fundamentals, international 
vegetable oil prices have remained relatively elevated, 
with the FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index reaching its 
highest level since mid-2022 in August 2025, while the 
FAO Oilmeal Price Index has declined in recent months 
to its five-year lows.

Food Outlook 
November 2025
Source:  Prices refer to the Sugar No. 11 contract traded at the New York 
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)
FAO’s preliminary forecast for the 2025/26 season pegs 
global sugar production at 185.3 million tonnes, up 9.7 
million tonnes, or 5.5 percent, from 2024/25, marking 
a new record level. The increase mainly stems from 
anticipated bumper harvests in several key producing 
countries. In Brazil, the world’s largest sugar producer and 
exporter, output is forecast to rise by around 4.0 percent 
year on year, recovering from weather-related reductions 
in 2024/25. While a greater share of the sugarcane 
harvest is expected to be directed to ethanol production, 
the volume allocated to sugar manufacturing is also 
set to expand. A strong rebound in production is also 
anticipated in India, supported by adequate cumulative 
monsoon rainfall and an expansion in planted area, 
induced by comparatively higher returns for sugar cane 
relative to alternative crops, such as soybean, wheat, 
maize and sorghum. In Thailand, the world’s second-
largest sugar exporter, output is likewise expected to 
increase, underpinned by favourable growing conditions 
despite localized outbreaks of white leaf disease. 
By contrast, sugar output in the European Union 
is forecast to decline, due to a reduction in sugar beet 
plantings as a result of lower price realizations and 
elevated input costs. Elsewhere, production is set to 
decline in Australia, the Russian Federation and the 
United States of America, while increases are anticipated 
in China, Indonesia and Mexico, compared with 
2024/25 levels.
World sugar consumption in 2025/26 is forecast 
to rise by 1.3 percent, a slightly faster pace than the 
previous year, supported largely by lower sugar prices 
despite subdued global economic prospects. The 
expansion in consumption is expected to be led by Africa, 
driven by continued population growth and urbanization, 
and in Asia, where strong demand from the food and 
beverage industry continues to underpin demand.
Global sugar trade in 2025/26 is preliminarily forecast 
at 65.2 million tonnes, up 3.0 percent from the previous 
season. Despite higher global production, trade growth 
is anticipated to remain moderate, as increased exports 
from countries such as Brazil and India are expected 
to be partly offset by reduced exportable availabilities 
in Europe.
In October 2025, international sugar prices declined to 
their lowest levels since December 2020, with favourable 
weather conditions bolstering 2025/26 production 
prospects in Brazil, India and Thailand. Additional 
downward pressure on prices stemmed from expectations 
of weaker global economic growth during the year.

Food Outlook 
November 2025 
World meat production is forecast to reach 384 million 
tonnes (carcass weight equivalent) in 2025, up 1.4 percent 
from 2024. The increase is mainly driven by expectations of 
a higher poultry meat output, along with gains in pig meat 
and modest growth in ovine meat, partially offset by a decline 
in bovine meat production. Global poultry meat production 
is projected to expand on the back of relatively lower feed 
costs and robust demand driven by its affordability. Despite 
continued high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks 
in major producing regions, the overall impact on broiler 
output has remained limited. Global pig meat production 
is expected to grow, underpinned by improved productivity 
and enhanced herd management efficiency. However, 
recurrent African Swine Fever (ASF) outbreaks, particularly in 
Asia and Europe, continue to hinder disease control efforts. 
Ovine meat output is also forecast to rise slightly, as declines 
in Oceania – due to smaller flocks, although partly offset by 
higher slaughter of older breeding ewes with heavier carcass 
weights – are expected to be balanced by increases elsewhere. 
By contrast, global bovine meat production is anticipated to 
contract, reflecting reduced cattle inventories, notably in Brazil 
and the United States of America, following several years of 
high slaughter levels prompted by weather-related factors and 
strong global demand.
Global meat trade is forecast to expand by 1.7 percent 
in 2025, reaching 43.0 million tonnes. Tight bovine meat 
supplies, strong import demand, animal disease-related 
trade restrictions, and tariffs are reshaping trade patterns 
and contributing to continued volatility in international meat 
flows. Growth is expected to be led by bovine meat, with 
Australia expanding shipments to the United States, where 
domestic supplies remain limited, and Brazil increasing its 
sales to alternative markets following higher tariffs imposed 
by the United States. Firm global demand is also anticipated 
to boost poultry meat exports, although HPAI-related 
restrictions on Brazil have slowed growth, enabling smaller 
exporting countries to gain market share. Pig meat trade will 
likely expand, as increasing exports by Brazil are expected 
to outweigh reduced shipments from the European Union, 
particularly to China, following the imposition of provisional 
duties in September. By contrast, global ovine meat trade is 
forecast to decline, constrained by limited exportable supplies 
in key producing countries. 
International meat prices, as measured by the FAO Meat 
Price Index, have trended upwards in 2025, led by increases 
in bovine and ovine meat quotations, both reaching new 
historical highs. The increase reflects limited global export 
availabilities, sustained import demand, and heightened 
market uncertainty stemming from animal disease outbreaks 
and geopolitical tensions.

Food Outlook 
November 2025
Global milk production in 2025 is forecast to expand 
by 1.4 percent, up from 1.1 percent growth recorded 
in 2024, marking a moderate recovery in global output 
growth. The increase mainly reflects continued output 
expansion in Asia – though at a slower pace – alongside 
faster growth in Central and South America.
In Asia, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are anticipated 
to register mainly herd-driven gains, supported by 
gradual productivity improvements, while in China, 
output – which fell 2.8 percent in 2024 amid low farm-
gate prices that prompted the exit of smaller producers 
−  is expected to gradually stabilize, as productivity gains 
resulting from the consolidation among larger producers  
could limit the impact of ongoing herd reductions.
In the European Union, milk production in 2025 is 
forecast to rise slightly overall – although at a slower 
year on year pace – reflecting expected diverging trends 
among Member States. Stable feed costs and recovery 
from high Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) related 
disruptions have supported higher output in the United 
States, while high farm-gate prices and conducive 
conditions have induced an upturn in New Zealand.
Global dairy trade in milk-equivalent terms is 
forecast to contract by 1.3 percent in 2025, mainly 
reflecting firm international prices, which have impacted 
consumer purchasing power and weighed on demand. 
This contraction has been compounded by currency 
depreciation in several emerging markets, while improved 
domestic milk availability in key importing countries 
– particularly Algeria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia – and 
ongoing trade policy uncertainties have further limited 
global import demand. These factors more than offset a 
foreseen modest growth in imports by China, the world’s 
largest dairy importer, where restocking and increased 
use in feed and nutritional applications underpinned a 
modest import recovery. In terms of prices, international 
dairy markets remained firm in 2025 despite recent 
declines. The FAO Dairy Price Index averaged 142.2 
points in November, down 7.0 percent from May, 
yet 17.0 percent above the 2024 January to October 
average. Prices rose across all major products, led by 
cheese and whole milk powder, reflecting sustained 
demand in key Asian and Near Eastern markets. Skim 
milk powder recorded only marginal gains amid ample 
export supplies and subdued buying interest following 
earlier stock accumulation. Butter prices, after reaching 
record highs in June, eased in the second half of the 
year as milk-output prospects improved and competition 
among exporters intensified.

Food Outlook 
November 2025 
Global fisheries and aquaculture production is forecast to 
reach 197 million tonnes in 2025, an increase of  
3.3 million tonnes over 2024 levels (up 1.7 percent). 
Capture fisheries output will remain relatively stable at 
92.9 million tonnes (up 0.7 percent). Recent scientific 
guidance called for additional reductions in certain cod, 
haddock and mackerel stocks, which is expected to 
reduce catches of these species. Aquaculture continues 
to be the driver of growth in supply, and is estimated to 
add 2.7 million tonnes in 2025, enabling a 2.7 percent 
increase from 2024. While tilapia production growth 
stalled, harvests of other major aquaculture species 
– carp, salmon, catfish and shrimp – all saw strong 
increases.
Global trade in aquatic products continues to expand 
in 2025, up 2.1 percent in volume terms. Shrimp, the 
most valuable traded commodity in the sector, saw 
particularly strong demand and supply. Other major 
traded commodities, such as salmon and tuna, also 
experienced healthy growth, although trade in some 
categories of groundfish and pelagics was negatively 
affected by falling catch volumes. The main gains for 
exporters were recorded by Viet Nam, which added 
USD 1 billion in 2025, driven by strong shipments of 
frozen pangasius fillets and live lobster; Ecuador, which 
increased exports by USD 900 million through higher 
sales of frozen raw shrimp; and India, which exported 
USD 800 million more, primarily in both raw and 
processed frozen shrimp.
In terms of prices, although the FAO Fish Price Index 
fell in the first five months of 2025, prices rebounded, 
standing at 121 points in September, one point higher 
than at the start of the year. Index prices for capture 
fisheries rose sharply since the beginning of 2025, while 
aquaculture prices initially declined before recovering 
and now stand above their levels from September 
2024. Driven largely by reduced supply, whitefish from 
capture fisheries rose by 11 points from the start of the 
year, while pelagics (excluding tuna) grew by 50 points. 
Among aquaculture species, shrimp rose by 11 points 
during 2025 following an extended period of depressed 
prices, while salmon declined by 11 points on the back of 
increased supply.

Food Outlook
November 2025
Fertilizer market developments
Contributed by: 
Maria Antip 
The Fertilizer Market Update provides an overview of 
key developments in global fertilizer markets since the 
June edition of Food Outlook, covering  production and 
consumption, input costs, prices, trade, as well as the 
short-term outlook.
Production, utilization and fertilizer input 
costs
Nitrogen and potash fertilizer production rebounded 
sharply in the 2024/25 season (July/June), though plant 
utilization rates remain below the highs of the 2010s, 
as capacity expansion of production plants continues 
to outpace fertilizer demand. By contrast, phosphate 
capacity growth has been slower, keeping utilization 
at the production plant level steady amid a gradual, 
affordability-driven demand recovery. Global forecasts 
foresee steady nutrient capacity growth of around 2 
percent annually through 2030.
On the demand side, the International Fertilizer 
Association (IFA) reports that after two years of decline 
due to elevated price levels, including the price peaks of 
2022, global fertilizer utilization rose by 6 percent to 200 
million tonnes of nutrients in 2024, just below the 2020 
record high of 203 million tonnes. Nitrogen use reached 
a record level of 115 million tonnes, 2 million tonnes 
more than in 2020, driving a 2 kg/ha increase in the 
average global fertilizer application rate across all planted 
crops. 
The partial rebound in global fertilizer use in 2024 
was mainly driven by lower fertilizer prices, a trend that 
continued through the first half of 2025, when prices 
began to increase before softening as of August 2025. 
Demand for nitrogen and potash rose in 2024 and 
2025, while phosphorus demand remained stable. In the 
first half of 2025, demand for all three nutrients showed 
signs of decline compared to 2024, as fertilizer use is 
closely tied to its affordability. Overall, nitrogen demand 
proved more resilient than phosphorus and potassium, 
reflecting its critical role in crop development and thus 
yields.
Nitrogen demand growth has been driven mainly 
by India, supported by increased urea subsidies and 
a reduction in the goods and services tax (GST) on 
agricultural inputs and farm machinery (down from 18 
percent to 5 percent). The growth was also supported 
by China, where a renewed focus on agricultural self-
sufficiency via an increased use of inputs has played a key 
role.
As of October 2025, phosphorus demand remains in 
recovery, with persistent weakness in East Asia, South 
Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia, as elevated 
phosphate prices have led farmers to reduce usage or 
switch to products with lower phosphorus content.
The rebound in potash demand has been driven by 
Brazil, China, Indonesia and Malaysia, which together 
increased potash use by over 2 million tonnes in the 
past two years compared to 2023, due to improved 
affordability.
The cost of productionx – and thus the availability 
- of mineral fertilizers is closely tied to energy prices. 
Natural gas is a critical input for all nitrogen fertilizers, 
as well as for widely used phosphorus fertilizers such as 
monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and diammonium 
phosphate (DAP), and for various nitrogen, phosphorus 
and potassium (NPK) blends.
Stable natural gas prices support predictable fertilizer 
production and supply. In 2024, the Dutch natural gas 
Title Transfer Facility (TTF) index – the main reference 
market for gas trading in Europe - averaged EUR 35/
megawatt hour, down 15 percent (or EUR 6/megawatt 
hour) compared to the 2023 annual average.

Food Outlook
November 2025
Early in 2025, the TTF index surged to EUR 58/
megawatt hour, driven by a burst of cold weather across 
parts of the Northern Hemisphere and a shortfall in 
North Sea wind output, although prices remained well 
below the 2022 levels. Since that spike, prices have eased 
substantially. By September 2025, the TTF benchmark 
was trading at EUR 32–33/megawatt hour, roughly half 
the February peak, as summer refill activity, weaker 
near-term demand, and ample liquefied natural gas 
(LNG) flows weighed on the market. EU gas inventories 
reportedly reached about 75 percent of working 
capacity by late August 2025 after a large injection 
effort and additional LNG imports. Inventory rebuilding 
has reduced immediate price pressure, with the latest 
reports suggesting that the European Union has achieved 
its storage target of 90–95 percent. However, ongoing 
geopolitical risks mean that price volatility remains a 
concern heading into the winter.
In 2025 to date, natural gas prices have been 
less volatile than during the spikes of late 2021 and 
throughout 2022. However, price levels rose by 19 
percent to an average of EUR 38/megawatt hour for 
January–October 2025, an increase of EUR 6/megawatt 
hour compared to the same period in 2024.
Despite higher natural gas prices, the increase in 
fertilizer production costs has been more moderate 
in 2025 to date than during previous peak years. In 
addition to more contained changes in natural gas prices 
compared to 2022, increased structural resilience in 
fertilizer production, particularly among those plants that 
have the option to import natural gas and/or ammonia 
from regions with lower productions costs such as the 
Near East and North Africa, has also played a role. Plant 
shutdowns in 2025 were mainly related to maintenance 
works rather than feedstock supply shocks. Nonetheless, 
regional conflicts continued to weigh on energy markets, 
occasionally triggering short-lived spikes in fertilizer 
prices. Intra-month energy cost volatility remains a 
challenge for fertilizer producers, particularly in Europe, 
where the cost base of production is higher due to other 
structural factors such as labour costs and environmental 
mitigation requirements.
Prices 
In 2024 the average export price of a fertilizer basket1 
was USD 336/tonne, compared to USD 375/tonne 
in 2023, representing a decline of 10 percent. In 
1	 The basket consists of the weighted average of export (free on board [FOB]) 
prices for nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium. It includes the following 
products: urea, urea ammonium nitrate (UAN), ammonium nitrate and 
ammonium sulphate, diammonium phosphate (DAP), monoammonium 
phosphate (MAP), triple-superphosphate (TSP), and muriate of potash (MOP). 
The weights used for each nitrogen (0.50), phosphorus (0.19) and potassium 
(0.31) reflect the percentage share of exports over 2019–2023.

Food Outlook
November 2025
September 2025, export prices of a fertilizer basket of 
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium averaged USD 489/
tonne – 46 percent higher than in September 2024, but 
still 40 percent below the historical peak of USD 815/
tonne recorded in April 2022. 
The effect of higher natural gas prices in 2025 is 
most readily reflected in nitrogenous fertilizer prices, 
which averaged USD 359/tonne in January–September 
2025, higher 23 percent than during the same period 
in 2024. Phosphatic fertilizers (diammonium phosphate, 
monoammonium phosphate and triple superphosphate) 
also recorded a steep price increase in the first nine 
months of 2025, averaging USD 662/tonne, up 21 
percent from USD 547/tonne in the same period in 
2024.
The only fertilizers not directly linked to natural gas 
price developments are potassic fertilizers (muriate of 
potash and sulphate of potash), whose prices recorded 
a milder increase in the first nine months of 2025, 
averaging USD 306/tonne compared to USD 272/tonne 
during the same interval in 2024, a rise of 13 percent 
year on year.
Different nutrients are influenced by distinct market 
fundamentals and development in trade policies. The 
price increases across all three nutrient groups were 
driven by a myriad of concurrent factors, including 
regional demand seasonality, maintenance-related supply 
disruptions at production plants, stable natural gas 
supply, and trade policy measures. By the end of August, 
nitrogen and phosphates prices began to show signs of 
easing, driven by lower demand from key markets such 
as Brazil and India, where persistently high prices had 
started to erode affordability.

Global fertilizer trade
In 2024, global fertilizer trade volume – measured in 
gross product tonnes rather than nutrients –  returned 
to the 2020 and 2021 levels, exceeding 170 million 
tonnes and representing a 4 percent increase from the 
164 million tonnes traded in 2023. Despite the higher 
volumes, total trade value declined by 10 percent in 2024 
to USD 66 billion, on account of lower international 
prices. 
So far in 2025, trade data indicate that between 
January and September, global fertilizer trade volumes 
reached 115 million tonnes, while trade value totaled 
USD 48 billion. For the same period in 2024, volumes 
were higher at 132 million tonnes, valued at USD 51 
billion. The smaller decline in trade values compared to 
volumes highlights the price increases through much of 
2025 relative to 2024.
The lower year-to-date volume can be partly explained 
by a delayed start of the 2025/26 application season due 
to unfavourable weather conditions across much of the 
northern hemisphere. 
Uncertainty around changes in trade policies and the 
impact of tariffs, as well as exchange rate volatility and 
credit financing issues, have altered buyers’ behaviour.
Overall, total fertilizer trade in 2025, in both volume and 
value terms, will ultimately depend on fertilizer price 
trends and their affordability relative to crop prices.
Short-term outlook (from November 2025 
to March 2026)
Nitrogen supply is likely to remain adequate, even though 
no major capacity additions are expected in the remainder 
of the year. After a two-year absence from global 
markets, China resumed urea exports In July and extended 
its export window through the end of the year, allowing 
shipments of up to 2 million tonnes. Between June and 
September, China exported over 1 million tonnes, with 
the top destinations being Brazil, Ethiopia, Pakistan, the 
Republic of Korea, and Sri Lanka. Demand for urea is 
expected to remain robust, with India continuing to issue 
tenders periodically to ensure sufficient domestic supplies 
ahead of rabi season 2026 (October–March). Upward 
price pressure could develop if the main demand windows 
in Brazil, India and Europe overlap, particularly as major 
European buyers (France, Italy and Spain) have delayed 
spring purchases. In Europe, prices of nitrate are expected 
to decline as weak affordability constrains demand, but 
they could recover toward December 2025 as buyers

advance purchases ahead of the planned implementation 
of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM). 
In Brazil, ammonium sulphate demand has picked up 
since August 2025, causing a modest rebound of free on 
board (FOB) prices from Europe and China, the country’s 
main suppliers. However, increases remain limited by 
abundant export supply from China, continued port 
storage bottlenecks, and softer urea prices.
Phosphate prices have continued to decline since 
August but remained well above their levels at the start 
of the year. Further easing is anticipated in the coming 
months, though prices are likely to stay historically high 
due to limited supply. Indian DAP import demand is 
foreseen to stay firm, although buyers are in a strong 
position given high stock levels while awaiting clarity 
on rabi season subsidies, potentially pushing for lower 
price. Ethiopia’s shift from one type of compound 
fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphate and sulphur blends) to 
diammonium phosphate (DAP) has added over 1 million 
tonnes of demand to the global market in 2025 – a 
trend likely to persist through 2026. In Brazil, MAP prices 
have eased, butt buyers are expected to remain cautious 
due to weak barter ratios, credit constraints, and ample 
stocks supported by strong imports of alternative 
phosphate sources such as triple superphosphate (TSP). 
Potash prices are predicted to remain steady, with a 
gradual downward trend expected across most regions 
over the coming months, as weak demand continues to 
pressure spot markets. Muriate of potash (MOP) prices 
peaked in July but have since eased due to weakening 
affordability and ample supply from Belarus, Canada, 
and the Russian Federation. While demand is expected 
to remain generally steady, it may soften in key markets 
such as China, India and the United States of America. 
By contrast, Southeast Asia is set to lead global demand 
growth, supported by high palm oil prices pushing up 
MOP prices, whereas Brazil is likely to face affordability 
pressures.

Focus on olive oil
Contributed by: 
Di Yang
A feature article in the November 2024 edition of the 
Food Outlook offered an in-depth analysis of global olive oil 
production and examined conditions prevailing at that time. 
The current edition presents a market update and forecasts 
for the 2025/26 season.
International olive oil prices down markedly 
after reaching record highs in early 2024
Following a robust recovery in global olive oil production 
in the 2024/25 (October/September) marketing season, 
international prices declined significantly from their peak 
reached in early 2024. In Spain, the world’s leading olive 
oil producer, wholesale prices of extra virgin olive oil (cold 
pressed from the fruit, without chemical or heat treatment) 
dropped sharply from nearly EUR 9 000 (USD 10 440) per 
tonne in January 2024 to EUR 4 180 (USD 4 849) per tonne 
in September 2025, which is 13.9 percent lower than the 
five-year average. Similarly, extra virgin olive oil prices in 
Greece also fell almost continuously from a historical high of 
EUR 8 460 (USD 9 814) per tonne in January 2024 to EUR 4 
100 (USD 4 756) per tonne at the end of 2024/25 season. 
An exception, however, was observed in Italy, one of 
the leading olive oil producers in the world. In contrast to 
recovering supplies in other major producing countries 
across the Mediterranean basin, Italy’s 2024/25 harvest was 
severely affected by prolonged drought from June to August

2024, which hindered fruit development particularly in the 
southern growing regions. As a result, national olive harvest 
declined by nearly 25 percent from the previous season. 
Reflecting the lack of production recovery, prices of Italian 
extra virgin olive oil remained elevated and, unlike prices in 
Greece and Spain, reached record highs in mid-2025. At 
over EUR 9 500 (USD 11 020) per tonne in September 2025, 
quotations were 40.6 percent higher than the past five-year 
average. 
Global olive oil production in 2025/26 to 
remain above past five-year average
As harvesting of the 2025/26 crop progresses, preliminary 
forecasts indicate a stable global olive oil output of 3.4 
million tonnes, marginally below the level estimated for 
the previous season. Production in Spain is expected to 
trail marginally behind last year’s level but still account for 
about 40 percent of global production. While beneficial 
rainfall from March to May 2025 in key growing regions 
supported favourable crop development during flowering 
and pollination stages, excessive heat and dryness since June 
2025 have hampered yield prospects. Evidently, weather 
conditions in the coming months will remain critical in 
determining the final harvest outcome. 
On the southern Mediterranean coast, Tunisia is 
anticipated to harvest a record-breaking crop, supported 
by ample precipitation throughout the growing season. 
At more than 400 000 tonnes, the preliminary forecast 
could position Tunisia as the world’s second largest olive oil 
producer in 2025/26, accounting for 13 percent of global 
output. Meanwhile, production in Italy is expected to 
recover from the drought-reduced harvest of the previous 
season, largely underpinned by favourable conditions in the 
southern regions of the country. 
By contrast, olive oil production in Greece is expected to 
decline year on year. Besides the natural alternate bearing 
of olive trees – where a high-yield season is usually followed 
by a low-yield harvest – the crop has also been negatively 
affected by prolonged drought in parts of the main growing 
regions. Likewise, production in Türkiye is also forecast to 
decline from its record harvest registered in the previous 
season.

World olive oil consumption and trade 
expected to expand in 2025/26
Consumers had faced elevated olive oil prices since late 
2022, as protracted droughts reduced global production, 
particularly in Spain, for two consecutive seasons. However, 
with benchmark prices in major exporting countries 
embarking on a declining trend in 2024 and falling 
sharply thereafter amid improving global supplies, world 
olive oil consumption is projected to continue recovering. 
Consumption already showed gradual recovery since early 
2025 in response to more affordable prices. Yet, as the 
2025/26 season starts with relatively low opening stocks, 
global utilization will unlikely recover fully to the record level 
reached before 2022/23. 
In line with the anticipated recovery in consumption, 
global trade in olive oil is forecast to expand to over 1.3 
million tonnes, potentially reaching a historical high. The 
European Union is anticipated to remain the world’s leading 
exporter, largely supported by ample export availabilities 
in Spain – although higher import tariffs imposed by 
the United States of America may curb trade volumes. 
Meanwhile, preliminary forecasts of a record harvest in 
Tunisia could boost the country’s share in global olive oil 
trade. By contrast, smaller expected production in Türkiye, 
traditionally one of the major olive oil exporters, is expected 
to limit its export capacity in 2025/26. On the import side, 
lower prices are expected to raise purchases across major 
markets, including Brazil, China, the European Union, and 
the United States of America. 
Challenges for the olive oil sector remain 
Although world olive oil production is expected to remain 
steady in 2025/26, producers continue to face several 
challenges that affect the sector’s long-term profitability 
and sustainability. Irregular weather patterns and prolonged 
droughts across key producing regions represent the 
most pressing issues. In addition to reducing yields and 
compromising oil quality, overly warm conditions favour 
the spread of diseases such as Xylella fastidiosa. Rising 
production costs also pose another major challenge. As a 
labour-intensive industry, olive oil production is particularly 
sensitive to high labour and input costs, which make it 
difficult for smallholder producers to maintain profitability. 
For exporters, stable trade relations and a predictable 
trading environment are essential for building and 
maintaining business with international buyers. Consistent 
trade policies and clear regulatory standards not only 
support exporters in developing long-term partnerships 
with distributors and retailers but also help them reduce 
compliance and transaction costs. In addition, effective 
regulations on border control and fraud prevention are 
particularly important for a product like olive oil, whose 
quality is closely linked to its origin and authenticity. 
Consistent product quality will strengthen consumer 
confidence and support steady demand from end users.

Prices
Since the start of the 2025/26 marketing year in July, 
wheat futures have traded near five-year lows. On the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), contracts for 
nearest delivery hovered around USD 190 per tonne, 
while milling wheat on Euronext traded near USD 220 
per tonne. Wheat futures markets came under pressure 
from a comfortable global supply outlook, which has 
intensified competition among exporters. Some support 
stemmed from the measured pace of shipments from the 
Black Sea region, but a more significant price rebound

remains contingent on stronger demand signals, which

CME maize futures showed a firmer tone, rebounding 
from a five-year low of USD 150 per tonne in July to over 
USD 170 per tonne by late October. While early prospects 
of a large harvest in the United States of America 
initially weighed on prices in July, a subsequent rebound 
was supported by robust export demand and growing 
market concerns that mounting disease pressures could 
negatively impact final crop yields. The continued rise 
in CME maize futures prices will depend on the ability 
of the United States to sustain strong exports amid
