EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
COMMODITY MARKETS OUTLOOK | OCTOBER 2025 
1 
 
 
Recent developments 
Commodity markets have been impacted by a 
confluence of factors over the past six months, 
leaving prices below 2024 levels. Continued 
subdued economic activity, trade restrictions and 
associated high economic policy uncertainty, and 
weather-related supply shocks have all affected 
commodity markets. Energy prices, in particular, 
have pulled down the World Bank Group’s overall 
commodity price index (figure 1.A). The softening 
of commodity prices in nominal U.S. dollars 
would have been larger without the depreciation 
of the dollar since early 2025. 
In energy markets, the announcement of a new set 
of U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies in late 
October was followed by spike in oil prices. Prior 
to recent events, Brent oil prices declined by 14 
percent in the first nine months of the year (y/y), 
reflecting an oversupplied market and sluggish 
global growth. Over the past two years, oil de-
mand growth in China, a key source of demand, 
has been sharply below its 2015-19 average, 
weighing on prices, while growth in the rest of the 
world has been broadly steady (figure 1.B). 
Increasing oil production by eight OPEC+ 
members since April, on top of continued strong 
gains in non-OPEC countries, has put additional 
downward pressure on prices. The U.S. bench-
mark for natural gas prices rose by 64 percent in 
Commodity prices are expected to decline by about 7 percent overall this year, reflecting subdued global 
economic activity, elevated trade tensions and policy uncertainty, and ample global supply of oil. In 2026, 
commodity prices are forecast to fall by a further 7 percent, a fourth consecutive year of decline, as global growth 
remains sluggish and the oil market oversupplied. Energy price movements are expected to continue contributing 
to global disinflation in 2026. Metals and minerals prices are projected to remain stable in 2026, while 
agricultural prices are forecast to edge down, primarily due to strong supply conditions. Precious metals prices 
are projected to rise another 5 percent, after a historically large, investment-driven rally of about 40 percent in 
2025. Risks to the commodity price projections are tilted to the downside. Key downside risks include weaker-
than-expected global growth, a longer-than-assumed period of economic policy uncertainty, and additional 
oversupply of oil. Upside risks include intensifying geopolitical tensions, the market impact of additional oil 
sanctions, supply reductions stemming from additional trade restrictions, unfavorable weather conditions, and 
faster-than-expected rollout of new data centers. Commodity price volatility in recent years has revived interest 
in supply management via international commodity agreements. Historical experience, however, shows that the 
most effective policy is to promote diversification, innovation, transparency, and market-based pricing—
measures that build lasting resilience to commodity price volatility. 
Executive Summary 
the first nine months of the year (y/y) as European 
demand for U.S. liquified natural gas (LNG) 
surged due to reduced electricity output from 
renewable sources and efforts to build stocks.  
Recent developments in base metals markets have 
been shaped by evolving trade policy and econom-
ic conditions in China. Metal prices recovered in 
2025Q3 after declining earlier in the year, reflect-
ing resilient demand in major economies. In the 
lead-up to the U.S. tariffs, importers front-loaded 
purchases of aluminum and copper, contributing 
to short-term market tightening. For copper, 
accelerated shipments to the United States lifted 
onshore inventories ahead of the August tariffs 
and widened the price spread between the 
COMEX and LME exchanges (figure 1.C). In 
addition, an accident at one of the world’s largest 
mines in September caused a spike in copper 
prices. Iron ore prices rebounded in the third 
quarter, supported by expectations of record-high 
steel exports and a temporary pickup in Chinese 
steel production, despite a prolonged downturn in 
the property sector.  
Among precious metals, for which prices have 
risen for eight consecutive quarters, gold has 
surged to successive record highs in the second 
half of 2025 on strong investment demand due to 
its safe-haven status amid elevated geopolitical 
uncertainty, macroeconomic factors such as recent

 U.S. monetary easing, and heightened policy 
uncertainty, reinforced by a weaker U.S. dollar 
(figure 1.D). Silver prices have also risen to record 
levels, reflecting the metal’s dual roles as a safe-
haven asset and a key input in fast-growing 
renewable 
energy 
applications. 
Geopolitical 
uncertainty and a weakening U.S. dollar were also 
factors behind the last major surge in gold prices, 
in 1979-80, but a distinguishing feature of the 
current rally is the unprecedented pace of gold 
purchases by central banks.  
In food commodity markets, prices edged down 
for the third consecutive quarter in 2025Q3 (q/q), 
driven by marked declines in grain prices—
notably rice, wheat, and maize—amid ample 
global supplies (figure 1.E). Soybeans, however, 
have been the target of fresh trade restrictions that 
have curtailed U.S. exports to China while signifi-
cantly increasing export opportunities for produc-
ers in Argentina and Brazil, contributing to a 
substantial gap between benchmark soybean prices 
in the United States and Brazil (figure 1.F). 
Although beverage commodity prices have retreat-
ed in recent months, prices of coffee remain close 
to all-time highs reached in early 2025, when 
weather-related challenges suppressed production.  
Fertilizer prices have continued to climb, by  
19 percent in the first nine months of 2025 (y/y), 
reflecting strong demand, the effects of trade 
restrictions, and production shortfalls. Combined 
with lower grain prices, higher fertilizer costs have 
reduced profits for many agricultural producers. 
Outlook 
The broadest index of commodity prices is 
projected to drop by 7 percent in 2025 (y/y) in 
nominal U.S. dollar terms and by a further  
7 percent in 2026, before rebounding by 4 percent 
in 2027 (table 1).1 Energy prices are expected to 
decline considerably in 2025 and 2026, although 
by far less than during the COVID-19 pandemic 
or the mid-2010s commodity price drop, while 
projected changes in non-energy prices are com-
paratively small (figure 2.A). For both years, price 
FIGURE 1 Recent developments in commodity markets  
Commodity prices have fallen since the beginning of 2025, largely driven 
by lower energy prices. A sharp decline in oil prices in 2025 reflects 
sluggish oil demand growth in China and excess global supply. Market 
anticipation of tariffs led to unusually wide price differentials across major 
copper exchanges for several months in 2025. Gold prices surged to 
successive record highs in the second half of the year, largely reflecting 
safe-haven demand. Food prices have continued to edge down, while 
beverage prices experienced a sharp, weather-related spike in the first half 
of the year.

forecasts have been upgraded since April, owing 
largely to global activity that has been more 
resilient than expected. The forecast for 2026 is 
predicated on the continuation of two major 
forces—subdued global economic growth and an 
oversupplied global oil market—as well as on the 
assumption of generally ample supplies of agricul-
tural and metal commodities. 
If realized, the baseline 2026 price forecast would 
mark the fourth consecutive year of decline, and a 
36 percent drop from the most recent peak in 
2022, following a surge of about 125 percent from 
2020 to 2022 (figure 2.B). The outlook implies 
that commodity prices would still be about  
14 percent higher in 2026 than they were in 2019, 
before the pandemic.  
Energy  
The World Bank Group’s energy price index is 
expected to fall by 12 percent in 2025 (y/y) and by 
an additional 10 percent in 2026, before rising by 
6 percent in 2027. The 2026 energy price forecast 
assumes that weakening oil prices will outweigh a 
projected rise in natural gas prices stemming from 
accelerating gas consumption. The Brent oil price 
is forecast to average $68/bbl (per barrel) in 2025, 
a sharp decline from $81/bbl in 2024, and to 
average $60/bbl in 2026. The oil price forecast 
envisages a continued slowdown in oil consump-
tion growth, reflecting very weak demand growth 
in China, continued rapid adoption of electric and 
hybrid vehicles, and a further rise in global oil 
supply (figure 2.C). Excess supply in the global oil 
market has expanded significantly in 2025 and is 
expected to rise next year to 65 percent above the 
most recent high, in 2020 (figure 2.D). 
Natural gas prices in the United States, Europe, 
and Asia are expected to diverge during the 
forecast period. After surging by an estimated 60 
percent in 2025, mainly owing to a sharp increase 
in LNG imports from Europe, the U.S. bench-
mark price is projected to rise by a further 11 
percent in 2026, before holding steady in 2027. 
The European benchmark price is expected to rise 
by 10 percent in 2025 but decline by about 11 in 
2026 and 9 percent in 2027, as plans for the 
European Union to phase out purchases of natural 
gas from Russia proceed. The benchmark LNG 
price in Japan is also projected to decline in 2026 
and 2027, on growing global LNG production.  
After falling by an estimated 21 percent in  
2025 (y/y), the Australian benchmark coal price is 
anticipated to fall by a further 7 percent in 2026. 
This forecast reflects expectations of subdued 
global growth, adequate supply conditions, and 
rising diffusion of renewable energy sources. 
Agriculture and fertilizers 
The World Bank Group’s agricultural commodity 
price index is projected to fall slightly, by 2 
percent in 2026 (y/y) and 1 percent in 2027, after 
FIGURE 2 Commodity market outlook  
Commodity prices are projected to decline by 7 percent in 2026 as energy 
prices fall further. If realized, the anticipated drop in commodity prices in 
2026 would mark the fourth consecutive year of decreases, although it 
follows a two-year spike in prices during the pandemic. In the oil market, 
continued excess supply, together with the rising adoption of electric 
vehicles and the subsequent reduction in demand for oil, are expected to 
keep downward pressure on prices.

 Following a rally to record-setting levels in 2025 
on continued strong investment demand, precious 
metal prices are set to rise further in 2026. Gold 
prices are projected to reach levels about 180 
percent above their 2015-19 average in 2026, 
supported by continued (though easing) central 
bank purchases and expectations of further U.S. 
monetary easing, amid still-elevated geopolitical 
risks and policy uncertainty. Silver prices are also 
expected to reach new record highs, supported by 
safe-haven and industrial demand.  
Risks 
Risks to the baseline commodity price projections 
remain tilted to the downside. Slower-than-
expected global output growth—perhaps stem-
ming from resurgent trade tensions, renewed 
policy 
uncertainty, 
or 
weaker-than-expected 
economic conditions in major economies—
remains a substantial risk that could weigh on the 
demand for energy and metals, pushing prices 
below baseline forecasts. Further oversupply in the 
oil market is another key downside risk.  
There are also upside risks to the commodity price 
outlook, including a deterioration in geopolitical 
conditions or increased sanctions, both of which 
could disrupt supplies of oil and other commodi-
ties, and lead to increased demand for precious 
metals. Other upside risks include new trade 
restrictions and supply disruptions, especially for 
energy-transition metals like copper and tin, where 
production is geographically concentrated and 
demand price-inelastic. Extreme weather events, 
such as a stronger-than-anticipated La Niña, could 
also trigger price spikes across agricultural and 
energy commodities, while stronger-than-expected 
investment in data centers could push up prices of 
natural gas and metals. 
Downside risks  
Slower global growth 
Global economic growth could fall short of the 
baseline if there are increased trade tensions or 
rising trade policy uncertainty. The resulting 
shortfall would particularly affect demand for 
energy and metals, which is closely linked to fixed 
investment and durable goods consumption. A 
holding steady in 2025. Food commodity prices, 
including all three sub-components—grains, oils 
and meals, and other foods—are forecast to 
fluctuate within narrow ranges around recent 
levels, as supply growth for key crops returns to 
long-term trends. Soybean prices are anticipated 
to drop in 2025, as U.S. supply that typically goes 
to China must be sold to other buyers at lower 
cost. The price of soybeans, a product at the 
center of ongoing trade restrictions between major 
economies, is forecast to be relatively stable in 
2026 and 2027. Lower prices are anticipated to 
curtail the area under cultivation in the United 
States, while Brazil is on track to expand its 
soybean acreage. Beverage prices are forecast to 
drop by 7 percent in 2026 and about 5 percent in 
2027, owing mainly to an expected improvement 
in supply conditions for coffee and cocoa.  
Fertilizer prices are projected to rise by 21 percent 
in 2025 (y/y), on strong demand, trade con-
straints, and isolated supply shortfalls. Although 
fertilizer prices are expected to ease by about 5 
percent in 2026 and again in 2027, they are set to 
remain well above their 2015–19 average due to 
elevated input costs and ongoing export re-
strictions and sanctions. China has restricted 
exports of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers, while 
Belarus—a major potash supplier—remains under 
EU sanctions. Together with Russia, it is also 
subject to new EU tariffs on fertilizers. 
Metals and minerals  
The index of metals and minerals prices tracked by 
the World Bank Group is projected to be essen-
tially flat (y/y) in 2026 and to rise by a moderate 2 
percent in 2027, following a 3 percent increase in 
2025, as rising demand related to investment in 
renewable energy, electric vehicles, and grid 
infrastructure offsets the drag from weak industrial 
activity and policy uncertainty.  
Base metals prices are forecast to rise by less than 1 
percent (y/y) in 2026 and about 3 percent in 
2027, following an estimated 5 percent increase in 
2025. The prices of copper and tin—critical for 
clean energy—are projected to reach new record 
levels in nominal U.S. dollar terms. Iron ore 
prices, however, are expected to fall below 2019 
levels as China’s property downturn continues.

deeper slowdown in China, perhaps stemming 
from continued weakness in the property sector or 
export-oriented manufacturing activity, could 
place even greater downward pressure on base 
metal prices.  
Oil market oversupply 
The oil market could become significantly over-
supplied due to rising non-OPEC+ production, 
notably from the U.S. shale industry. Oil prices at 
or below the baseline forecasts for 2025 and 2026 
are likely to restrain the drilling of new wells in the 
U.S. shale sector, but prices are still far above the 
levels required to cover the average operating 
expenses of existing wells, indicating that produc-
tion could exceed assumptions. Similarly, a larger-
than-expected increase in OPEC+ output could 
result from further reversals of approximately 3 
mb/d of announced cuts still remaining or from 
accelerated implementation of planned production 
increases, although some of the increases have 
been hindered by capacity constraints.  
Upside risks  
Additional geopolitical tensions and sanctions 
Oil and precious metals markets, in particular, 
remain sensitive to geopolitical developments, 
including active conflicts and attacks on oil 
infrastructure. The market impact of additional 
sanctions, such as the recently announced U.S. 
sanctions on Russian oil companies, could raise oil 
prices above the baseline forecast. The impact of 
sanctions will depend on the extent to which 
buyers are willing to risk breaching them, the 
secondary measures in place for those engaging 
with sanctioned parties, and the extent to which 
sanctioned parties can find alternate buyers. For 
precious metals, including gold and silver, escala-
tion of trade tensions, inflationary pressures, 
financial market stress, or armed conflict could lift 
prices higher than projected. 
Additional trade and production restrictions  
Metals have been increasingly subject to trade 
restrictions in recent months, including the 50 
percent U.S. tariff on semi-finished copper 
products introduced in August and new U.S. 
tariffs on aluminum and steel imposed earlier  
in the year. These new restrictions add to earlier 
measures, including EU curbs on Russian alumi-
num, Indonesia’s ban on exports of copper  
and nickel ores, and Myanmar’s tin export taxes. 
Further supply restrictions could push prices 
above projections and widen divergences across 
price benchmarks. Relatedly, disruptions from 
regulatory changes, shifts in policy priorities, or 
operational challenges that constrain supply could 
lift prices above projections, particularly for ener-
gy-transition metals with geographically concen-
trated production and price-inelastic demand. 
Adverse weather conditions 
A stronger-than-expected La Niña could bring 
weather that is hotter and drier than normal to 
major agricultural-producing regions, including 
Argentina, southern Brazil, and the U.S. Gulf 
Coast (figure 3.A). This could compromise the 
production of major staples such as maize, wheat, 
and soybeans and push prices above forecasts. La 
Niña could also cause flooding or landslides in key 
producing countries in East and South Asia, 
disrupting the planting season for rice and other 
crops. In energy markets, colder-than-expected 
winter temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere 
could put upward pressure on prices through both 
increased consumption and reduced supply from 
frozen gas fields. Meanwhile, heatwaves could 
increase electricity demand for air conditioning 
while reducing output, driving up prices of oil, 
coal, and alternative sources such as hydropower. 
Additionally, periods of intense rainfall could 
restrict coal mining. 
Faster-than-expected expansion in data centers 
The ongoing boom in artificial intelligence (AI) 
investment has resulted in a rapid surge in the 
construction of data centers, which is expected to 
continue in the medium term. A faster-than-
expected diffusion of AI could increase demand 
for electricity, especially in China, Europe, and the 
United States, and consequently put upward 
pressure on natural gas to support additional 
electricity production. At the same time, infra-

structure related to the faster-than-expected 
uptake of AI could push up prices of copper and 
aluminum. 
Broader implications 
Fiscal policy 
For oil-importing economies, lower oil prices 
create space for policy makers to reallocate public 
expenditures. In particular, the decline in oil 
prices reduces the need for fuel subsidies and 
presents an opportunity to shift expenditures to 
cash transfers to households, which are more 
targeted and typically less costly than subsidies, or 
to growth-enhancing investment in health, 
education, and investment in infrastructure and 
climate-related priorities. Budgetary resources 
released by reduced expenditures on subsidies 
could also be used to accumulate ﬁscal buﬀers, 
which in many economies are limited.  
Inflation 
Consumer price inflation has fallen closer to 
central bank targets in most countries over the 
past year. However, in recent months, it has 
flattened or even edged up in some advanced 
economies, while continuing to recede in emerg-
ing market and developing economies (EMDEs).  
Commodity price movements have supported 
disinflation since 2023, with decreases in energy 
prices, in particular, exerting downward pressure 
both directly through consumer energy costs and 
indirectly through their impact on goods prices. In 
the baseline forecast, energy price movements will 
help reduce consumer price inflation in 2026, 
shaving about 0.2 percentage point from global 
inflation in 2026, slightly less than the 0.3 per-
centage point estimated for 2025 (figure 3.B).  
Food security 
Falling prices of food commodities in 2025—
especially rice, but also for wheat and certain 
fruits—are likely to have helped improve the 
affordability of basic foods in some EMDEs. 
However, 
country-specific 
factors, 
including 
conflicts and economic developments, mean that 
changes in global prices do not consistently pass 
through to domestic prices.  
The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates 
that the number of people facing hunger globally 
will decline modestly in 2025, to 634 million, 
from 673 million at end-2024. This decline, 
however, follows several consecutive annual 
increases in the number of people facing hunger. 
Crop yields 
Fertilizer prices have increased nearly every month 
in 2025, reaching a level in 2025Q3 about 30 
percent higher than a year earlier. In contrast, food 
commodity prices have declined so far this year, 
and in 2025Q3 were 5 percent lower than a year 
earlier. This divergence, with costs of important 
inputs rising while output prices fall, has eroded 
many farmers’ profit margins. As a result, farmers, 
especially those with limited access to finance, may 
reduce fertilizer application rates in the 2025-26 
season, potentially lowering crop yields.  
FIGURE 3 Risks and broader implications of the 
commodity price outlook 
Weaker-than-expected global growth remains a key downside risk to the 
commodity price outlook. A stronger-than-expected La Niña could hinder 
production of several agricultural commodities, pushing up prices of 
maize, wheat, soybeans, and rice. Rapid rollout of generative AI (artificial 
intelligence) could push up prices of natural gas, used to fuel additional 
electricity production, and of copper and aluminum, used in data center 
infrastructure. The baseline outlook suggests that energy prices will 
continue contributing to global disinflation in 2026, although there are 
downside and upside risks to the forecast.

Special focus  
New shocks, old tools: Revisiting commodity 
agreements in a fragmented world 
Commodity price volatility in recent years—
driven by geopolitical tensions, trade policy 
uncertainty, pandemic-induced supply chain 
disruptions, and shifts in energy use—has sparked 
interest in coordinated market interventions 
(figure 4.A). There is a long history of internation-
al commodity agreements that attempt to target 
price levels or limit boom-and-bust cycles. These 
arrangements have used a variety of interventions, 
including inventory controls, trade restrictions, 
production quotas, and even price setting.  
Early efforts, mostly in the 1920s and 1930s, 
sought to influence price movements in coffee, 
tea, sugar, wheat, wool, rubber, copper, tin, 
aluminum, and silver markets, among others. 
Although some arrangements were temporarily 
successful at stabilizing prices, none were long-
lasting, and in many cases their collapse intensified 
price volatility (figure 4.B). Several post-World 
War II agreements involving both producers and 
consumers applied to tropical agricultural com-
modities (coffee, sugar, cocoa), as well as to wheat, 
rubber, and tin. Like their predecessors, none of 
these agreements remained successful for long, 
although several agreements evolved into organiza-
tions that continue to monitor market develop-
ments and facilitate information sharing.  
For oil, the Organization of the Petroleum Ex-
porting Countries (OPEC), formed in 1960, is the 
most successful and enduring collective effort to 
coordinate production and control prices. Yet even 
OPEC has faced challenges in maintaining its 
intended market power amid competition from 
nonmember suppliers, changing consumer behav-
ior, and shifts in energy use. Pressure from other 
suppliers has been particularly evident during 
periods of high oil prices (figures 4.C and 4.D). 
Historical experience with international commodi-
ty agreements offers cautionary lessons for current 
proposals to form industrial cartels or manage 
global food inventories. Temporary interventions 
during acute disruptions can be effective, but 
sustained price management schemes have a poor 
record, often leaving participants more vulnerable. 
Experience instead points to a more resilient 
approach: fostering diversification and production 
efficiency, investing in technology and innovation, 
improving data transparency, and relying on 
market-based pricing mechanisms. Such measures 
offer more durable protection against commodity 
price volatility than attempts to control prices and 
markets directly.  
FIGURE 4 Commodity price volatility and commodity 
agreements 
Commodity price volatility since 2020 has been higher than during the 
previous five decades, and is one of the reasons underlying renewed 
interest in international commodity agreements. Historically, the success of 
such agreements in containing price volatility has been mixed: volatility 
was lower for wheat and tin during the years agreements were active, 
higher for sugar, and little different for four other commodities. OPEC (the 
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Economies) has been the sole 
producer group to endure. Yet even OPEC has faced pressure from new 
sources of production, especially during periods of high oil prices.

increases has not been implemented yet. The fall 
in the Brent price since early this year has helped 
lower the Urals price below the $60/bbl price cap, 
before a new lower cap ($47.6/bbl) was intro-
duced in September (figure 5.C). Oil price 
volatility spiked following the increase in trade 
policy uncertainty in April and during the air-
strikes on the Islamic Republic of Iran’s nuclear 
facilities in June. It has since fallen near or below 
the average of the past five years, excluding the 
periods following the Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 
and the pandemic outbreak (figure 5.D). 
Energy 
Energy prices experienced a significant decrease in 
October, continuing their prevailing downward 
trend. Nevertheless, oil prices rose by 5 percent toward 
the end of the month following the announcement of 
new U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies. In 
2025 as a whole, the World Bank Group’s energy 
price index is projected to drop by 12 percent y/y, 
followed by a further 10 percent decline in 2026. 
This forecast assumes continued sluggish oil consump-
tion growth, surging oil supply, rising U.S. LNG 
exports, and a plateauing of coal consumption. Brent 
oil is forecast to average $68/bbl (per barrel) in 
2025, a sharp decline from $81/bbl in 2024—before 
decreasing to $60/bbl in 2026. After climbing 
sharply in 2025, the U.S. natural gas price is 
projected to increase by 11 percent in 2026, while the 
European natural gas price is expected to fall 11 
percent. Risks to the projections for energy prices are 
tilted to the downside and stem primarily from an 
oversupplied oil market and weaker-than-expected 
global growth. However, there are also upside risks to 
the forecast, including intensifying geopolitical 
tensions, the market impact of additional oil sanc-
tions, adverse weather conditions, and increased 
competition for LNG exports.  
Oil 
Recent developments 
The Brent oil price surged 5 percent upon the 
announcement of a new set of U.S. sanctions on 
Russian oil companies in late October. Prior to 
recent events, oil prices have fallen throughout 
2025, as trade policy tensions compounded 
concerns about excess supply, a decline occasional-
ly interrupted by spikes in response to geopolitical 
developments (figure 5.A). OPEC+ has markedly 
increased its production targets since April 2025 
through a series of monthly policy decisions. The 
planned production increases relate to the an-
nounced full reversal of the 2.2 million barrels- 
per-day (mb/d) cuts introduced in November 
2023 and a partial reversal of the 1.6 mb/d cuts 
implemented in April 2023 (figure 5.B). 
The impact on prices of this ongoing process, 
however, has been constrained by the fact that a 
significant share of the targeted production 
FIGURE 5 Oil market: Global price and market 
developments  
Before the recent decline, the Brent oil price rose 2 percent in 2025Q3, as 
geopolitical developments supported the market even as OPEC+ markedly 
increased its production targets. The Urals oil price dropped below the $60 
per barrel (bbl) price cap, before a more stringent cap was introduced in 
September. Price volatility spiked following the announcement of U.S. 
trade tariffs in April and during the airstrikes on the Islamic Republic of 
Iran’s nuclear facilities in June, but has since fallen below the average 
levels observed over the last several years—excluding the periods 
following the pandemic outbreak and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Global oil demand is estimated to have increased 
by 0.8 mb/d (0.7 percent) y/y in 2025Q3, to 
104.8 mb/d, indicating continued sluggish 
consumption growth relative to the 2015-19 
average. Annual oil consumption in advanced 
economies and China, which together account for 
about 60 percent of global demand, is expected to 
remain essentially unchanged in 2025 (figure 6.A). 
Elsewhere, oil demand growth is expected to 
soften in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), Latin 
America and the Caribbean (LAC) and South Asia 
(SAR) but remain stable in other emerging 
markets and developing economy (EMDE) 
regions, with the exception of Sub-Saharan Africa 
(SSA), where a significant rebound is ongoing 
(figure 6.B). Among the major contributors to oil 
consumption growth in 2025, India’s increase is 
primarily driven by higher demand for liquefied 
petroleum gas (LPG) and gasoline (figure 6.C). 
Global oil supply is estimated to have risen by 4.1 
percent in 2025Q3 y/y, double the increase in the 
previous quarter. In 2025, annual production 
growth is expected to resume in Middle East 
North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan (MNA), 
accelerate in LAC, and slow in advanced econo-
mies (figure 6.D). Computed OPEC+ spare 
capacity has decreased sharply from its September 
2024 peak of 7.3 mb/d, to about 3.9 mb/d in 
September 2025, reflecting an increase in OPEC+ 
production targets (figure 6.E).  
In part due to a shift in OPEC+ supply manage-
ment, the implied oil market balance (supply 
minus demand) is estimated to be 2.7 mb/d in 
2025Q3 (figure 6.F). This represents an excess of 
quarterly supply previously surpassed only during 
the 2020 pandemic and the 1998 oil market crisis. 
Global observed crude oil inventories in the year 
to August, however, increased by only about 0.9 
mb/d, or half the implied surplus in 2025Q1-Q3.1 
Three recent data points suggest a developing 
global oil supply glut. U.S. crude oil inventories 
declined in 2025Q3, during the U.S. driving 
season, but only at about a quarter of the average 
rate of the previous five years, while several crude 
oil cargoes in the Middle East recently went

reporting lags, inaccuracies, missing data or error in the models used 
by the IEA and other forecasting organizations.  
FIGURE 6 Oil market: Demand and supply 
Annual oil consumption in advanced economies and China is expected to 
be stable in 2025. Among emerging market and developing economies, oil 
demand growth in 2025 is on track to slow in Europe and Central Asia 
(ECA), Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and South Asia (SAR), but 
remain steady in most other regions. In India, a major contributor to oil 
demand growth, the increase in consumption in 2025 has been primarily 
driven by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and gasoline. Oil supply growth in 
2025 is expected to resume in the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, 
and Pakistan (MNA); accelerate in LAC; and slow in advanced economies. 
Increasing production targets announced by OPEC+ have reduced 
computed spare capacity, while contributing to continued oversupply.

unsold, amid a spike in the amount of oil in 
tankers at sea in September. 
Outlook 
The Brent oil price is projected to average $68/bbl 
in 2025, $13 less than in 2024. Prices are forecast 
to fall further to $60/bbl in 2026, as oil consump-
tion growth continues to moderate and oil supply 
continues to rise, before increasing to $65/bbl in 
2027 (figure 7.A).2 The price increase in 2027 
reflects a projected rebalancing of the oil market, 
as low prices in 2026 curtail excess supply. These 
forecasts assume no major escalation in armed 
conflicts, weak demand growth relative to the 
2015-19 average, a well-supplied oil market and 
stable OPEC+ production. 
Global oil supply is expected to increase signifi-
cantly in 2025 and 2026, as new production 
continues to come online. Output in 2025 is 
projected to grow by 3.0 mb/d y/y (2.9 percent) 
to 106.1 mb/d, a new all-time high, and to 108.5 
mb/d in 2026. According to International Energy 
Agency (IEA) projections, nearly half of the 2025 
increase is attributable to OPEC+, reflecting 
higher production targets. The IEA and other 
major oil market forecasting organizations project 
further supply growth in 2026, mainly in non-
OPEC countries.  
Global oil consumption is projected to expand 
only moderately in 2025 and 2026. The IEA 
anticipates an increase of approximately 0.7 mb/d 
in each year, whereas the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration forecasts a rise of 1.1 mb/d in 
both 2025 and 2026. China and India are ex-
pected to account for one-quarter of global 
consumption growth in 2025 and two-fifths in 
2026, according to the IEA. However, growth in 
China’s oil demand continues to be restrained by 
the rapid adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles, 
while demand in advanced economies is expected 
to remain broadly unchanged.  
As a result of sluggish demand growth and surging 
supply, a sizable surplus is expected to take hold of 
the oil market. In 2025Q4, supply is estimated to 
be 3.6 mb/d higher than demand. On an annual 
basis, the International Energy Agency anticipates 
the surplus to be 2.3 mb/d in 2025—rising to 4.0 
mb/d in 2026—1.6 mb/d above the surplus in 
2020, during the pandemic outbreak (figure 7.B). 
Risks 
Risks to the oil price forecast are tilted to the 
downside. Higher-than-expected oil output from 
OPEC+ represents the most significant downside 
risk to prices. Other risks include a sharper-than-
anticipated slowdown in the growth of oil de-
mand, for example due to a renewed rise in trade 
tensions. Conversely, a tighter-than-expected oil 
market, and additional geopolitical tensions or 
sanctions could push prices above current fore-
casts. 
Downside risk: Change in OPEC+ policy to 
raise output  
A rise in OPEC+ output relative to baseline 
assumptions may result from further increases in 
production targets or OPEC+ production rising 
closer to the announced targets. There are likely 
technical factors limiting some OPEC+ members' 
ability to expand production to match the group’s 
announcements since April 2025, but if these 
constraints are overcome, supply could rise beyond 
current baseline assumptions. In addition, as per 
the group’s announcements through early Octo-
ber, about 3.0 mb/d of OPEC+ production cuts 
remain in force, providing scope for higher 
output. 
Downside risk: Resurgent trade tensions and 
policy uncertainty 
Resurgent trade tensions could result in more 
restrictive trade policies or increased policy 
uncertainty, leading to a weaker global economic 
growth than assumed in the baseline. In this 
context, oil demand is likely to be weaker, espe-
cially in countries directly impacted, and the Brent 
price could sink below the baseline forecast, if 
economic growth remains subdue. 
Upside risk: Tighter-than-expected oil market 
Several major commodity forecasting organiza-
tions project that excess supply in the oil market 
will increase in 2026 (figure 7.C). However, a

2025 market conditions. U.S. oil output has 
declined from its December 2024 peak due to 
fewer operating rigs, and delays in investments, as 
the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price has 
been near or below the assumed $65/bbl break-
even point for new wells (figure 7.D).4 If produc-
ers prioritize profit over volume, U.S. supply 
could shrink further, supporting higher prices in 
2026. 
Upside risk: Additional geopolitical tensions  
and sanctions 
The oil market remains sensitive to geopolitical 
developments. An escalation of conflict in the 
Middle East or Ukraine, for example, could have 
significant energy market implications, as intensi-
fication of attacks on oil infrastructure, or the 
disruption of oil exports could each have lasting 
effects on oil prices. Furthermore, the market 
impact of additional sanctions, such as the recently 
announced U.S. sanctions on Russian oil compa-
nies, could raise oil prices above the baseline 
forecast. The effect of sanctions will depend on 
the extent to which international buyers are 
willing to risk breaching them, the secondary 
measures in place for those engaging with sanc-
tioned parties, and the extent to which sanctioned 
parties can find alternative buyers. Depletion of 
effective spare capacity in most OPEC+ countries 
following its planned production increases could 
sharpen the impact of geopolitical developments 
and sanctions, especially in the short term. 
Natural gas 
Recent developments 
The World Bank Group’s natural gas price index 
edged down in October, extending a 5 percent  
(q/q) decline in 2025Q3, as prices moderated 
from the spike early in the year (figure 8.A). 
Changes in U.S. and European benchmark prices 
have been strikingly divergent in recent months. 
Compared to a year earlier, U.S. benchmark prices 
were 44 percent higher in 2025Q3, reflecting 
strong demand for shipments of U.S. LNG to 
Europe, while the European benchmark was little 
changed. 
more constrained oil market remains possible. A 
tighter-than-expected oil balance could emerge if 
demand, especially in major non-OECD consum-
ers, exceeds expectations, or if oil supply growth 
falls short, for example due to production con-
straints in several OPEC+ countries.3 Uncertainty 
about the oil market balance in 2026 remains high 
and depends largely on producers’ responses to 
FIGURE 7 Oil market: Outlook and risks  
After falling sharply in 2025, to $68 per barrel (bbl), the Brent oil price is 
projected to decrease further to $60/bbl in 2026 before edging up to  
$65/bbl in 2027. The oil market glut is expected to increase in 2026, 
although considerable uncertainty remains regarding the magnitude of the 
supply-demand balance. Key downside risks include greater-than-
expected oil output from OPEC+ and a resurgence of trade tensions and 
policy uncertainty. Conversely, a tighter-than-expected oil market and 
higher prices could occur if supply is restrained through production curbs, 
increased geopolitical tensions, or new oil sanctions.

Global demand for natural gas in 2025H1 was 
boosted by a weather-related decrease in electricity 
output from renewables in Europe, and colder-
than-normal temperatures in North America.5 
Demand in Asia Pacific, particularly China and 
India, fell in 2025H1 on lower consumption by 
the industrial and refining sectors, and stronger 
renewable electricity production. For eleven 
consecutive months through September, China’s 
LNG imports were lower than a year earlier, 
reflecting higher domestic natural gas production 
and weak demand. 
Global supply of natural gas is estimated to have 
expanded in 2025H1, driven by strong perfor-
mance in North America. U.S. production was 
2.4 percent higher y/y, as high prices in 2025Q1 
led to a surge in output and exports. This was 
accompanied by a redirection of U.S. LNG flows 
to Europe, which received 57 percent of U.S. 
exports (figure 8.B). Relatively low levels of 
natural gas storage in Europe will require LNG 
imports to remain high during the 2025-26 
European heating season (figure 8.C). Production 
in Russia shrank by 3.2 percent in 2025H1, owing 
to recent reductions in pipeline supply to Europe 
and tepid growth in domestic demand.  
Outlook 
Natural gas prices are expected to take different 
directions over the forecasting horizon in the 
United States, Europe, and Asia. After surging in 
2025 by an estimated 60 percent y/y, the U.S. 
benchmark is projected to rise by 11 percent in 
2026 and stabilize in 2027 on higher LNG 
exports. After rising by an estimated 10 percent in 
2025, the European benchmark is projected to 
decline by 11 and 9 percent in 2026 and 2027 
respectively, owing to moderate demand and 
greater availability of LNG imports. Japan’s LNG 
price is expected to broadly track the European 
benchmark, reflecting continued competition for 
LNG between Asia Pacific and European markets. 
The forecast for natural gas prices is based on 
relatively tight markets, low exports from Russia, 
FIGURE 8 Natural gas markets 
The World Bank’s natural gas price index edged down by 5 percent (q/q) 
in 2025Q3, following a spike early in the year. Changes in U.S. and 
European benchmark prices have been remarkably divergent in 2025, with 
U.S. prices strongly rising and European prices little changed. About  
57 percent of U.S. LNG output was shipped to Europe in the first seven 
months of 2025, where natural gas storage levels are close to their  
2017-21 average. Global natural gas demand growth is projected to slow 
in 2025, with consumption stable in Asia Pacific and Eurasia, while supply 
expands most strongly in North America. The key upside risks to the price 
forecast include shortfalls in U.S. natural gas production relative to targets.

to the region’s production and export infrastruc-
ture could cause a prolonged price increase. 
Exports from gas fields in the Mediterranean 
could be at risk, as evidenced by the fact that an 
agreement between Israel and Egypt was recently 
put on hold. Tighter sanctions and restrictions on 
Russian LNG could be introduced if the Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine continues unabated. 
Upside risk: Colder-than-predicted  
temperatures 
Higher demand arising from colder-than-normal 
winter temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and 
Northeast, Europe and Asia could raise natural gas 
prices beyond baseline projections, especially if 
supply in North America is simultaneously 
constrained due to frozen gas fields. Weather-
related effects on prices could be amplified  
by ongoing market conditions—specifically, a 
relatively low amount of natural gas in European 
storage facilities, and in other consuming regions.  
Upside risk: Increased competition for LNG 
exports 
LNG imports to China tumbled by about 20 
percent in 2025H1, freeing up supply for other 
buyers. A reversal of this decline, which is not 
assumed in the baseline, could cause a surge in 
natural gas prices, especially given Europe’s need 
for LNG imports due to its lower storage and 
curtailment of Russian imports. A similar increase 
in competition for LNG imports could occur if 
the anticipated rise in U.S. production fails to 
materialize, for example because of a drop in the 
number of operating rigs or delays in new export 
capacity (figure 8.F). 
Upside risk: Faster-than-expected surge in 
construction of data centers 
The ongoing boom in artificial intelligence (AI) 
investment has resulted in a rapid surge in the 
construction of data centers. According to recent 
research, data centers could account for about 8 
percent of the increase in global electricity demand 
between 2024 and 2030.6 An even more rapid 
diffusion of AI could imply higher electricity 
demand, especially in China, Europe, and the 
6 International Energy Agency. 2025. Energy and AI. Paris: IEA.  
rising LNG exports, and a level of demand 
corresponding to normal seasonal temperatures. 
Over the remainder of 2025, prices are expected 
to remain broadly stable, as weak demand growth 
in Asia Pacific offsets supply constraints in Russia, 
where unutilized capacity in the natural gas sector 
continues to expand. For 2025 as a whole, global 
natural gas consumption is expected to reach 
about 4,270 bcm, an increase of about 60 bcm, or 
1.4 percent—half the increase recorded in 2024 
(figure 8.D). In 2026, a projected 1.9 percent rise 
in consumption to about 4,350 bcm assumes a 
rebound in demand in Asia-Pacific, as industrial 
activity recovers and demand from the power 
sector increases.  
On the supply side, global natural gas production 
is expected to grow by 1.7 and 2.4 percent in 
2025 and 2026, respectively, reaching 4,250 bcm 
in 2025 and 4,350 bcm in 2026. These increases 
are mostly driven by developments in North 
America—particularly, further growth in LNG 
exports, as new terminals come online (figure 
8.E). Qatar is also expected to contribute to the 
increase in supply, though by slightly less than 
projected previously, as the start of a major field 
expansion has been delayed to mid-2026. Growth 
in natural gas production in Russia is expected to 
remain constrained by international sanctions, the 
planned termination of purchases by Europe, and 
delays to upcoming projects. 
Risks 
Risks to the natural gas price forecast are tilted to 
the upside. Prices could rise above the baseline 
projection in the event of conflict-driven disrup-
tions to production and shipping in the Middle 
East, increasing competition for U.S. exports, 
colder temperatures during the Northern Hemi-
sphere winter or faster diffusion of artificial 
intelligence (AI) and data centers. Downside risks 
include higher LNG exports from Russia. 
Upside risk: Escalation of conflict and  
geopolitical risk 
Middle East natural gas production and exports 
could be adversely affected by an escalation of 
conflict in the region, raising international prices. 
While a blockage of the Strait of Hormuz, for 
example, might be short-lived, any lasting damage

19 
United States. This could raise demand for natural 
gas used in power generation with consequent 
increases in the three natural gas prices included in 
the World Bank Group’s index. 
Downside risk: Higher LNG exports from 
Russia 
LNG exports from Russia could exceed baseline 
assumptions if international sanctions are explicit-
ly or implicitly relaxed, for example through 
higher exports from the sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 
plant. The market reaction to the recent docking 
of ships carrying sanctioned Russian LNG at key 
international receiving terminals will help deter-
mine whether potential buyers are willing to risk 
breaching international sanctions. 
Coal 
Recent developments 
The price of Australian coal has remained  
relatively stable in October, following a $6 per ton 
(t) (6 percent) rebound in 2025Q3 that reversed 
the previous quarter’s decline (figure 9.A). The 
increase in 2025Q3 was driven by strong Asian 
demand owing to a number of heatwaves in the 
region, and lower exports from Australia and 
Indonesia. 
Global coal demand declined by approximately 1 
percent in 2025H1 (y/y), with changes across 
major consuming regions mainly reflecting 
differences in renewable electricity output and 
power demand. In China and India, coal power 
generation declined due to lower electricity 
consumption and increased renewable energy 
production. Conversely, U.S. coal consumption 
rose, driven by elevated power demand and higher 
natural gas prices. In the EU, increased coal use 
was primarily associated with a temporary reduc-
tion in output from renewable energy. 
Coal supply continued to grow in 2025H1 (y/y), 
primarily due to higher output from China and 
the United States. China’s coal production 
increased by 6 percent (y/y), recovering from a 
period of reduced output, while production in the 
United States expanded 8 percent. Contributing 
to upward price pressures, especially in 2025Q3, 
adverse weather disrupted production in Australia 
and Indonesia, the two largest exporters, with the 
latter also impacted by mining incidents. Output 
remained stable in India while falling in Russia, 
reflecting international sanctions and financial 
strains within the sector. 
Outlook 
The Australian coal price is projected to fall by 21 
percent in 2025 (y/y), decrease by a further 7 
percent in 2026, and recover in 2027. This 
forecast assumes subdued global economic growth 
and adequate supply conditions, while accounting 
for the prospect of increased power demand in 
EMDEs, and the continued expansion of renewa-
ble power sources. 
FIGURE 9 Coal markets 
The price of Australian coal rebounded by $6 per ton (6 percent) in 
2025Q3. Global consumption is projected to remain broadly stable over 
the forecast horizon, with production meeting demand requirements 
despite a decline in 2026. Key risks to the price outlook include—on the 
upside—higher-than-expected coal demand for power generation in 
China, and—on the downside—greater-than-expected coal output, 
especially in China and in the United States.

Upside risk: Increasing frequency or severity  
of extreme weather events 
Higher-than-normal temperatures, including dur-
ing heatwaves, drive up electricity demand for 
cooling, while at the same time reducing output 
from some power generation sources, such as 
hydropower. If the ability to rapidly increase 
electricity production from other sources is 
limited, demand for coal may rise, pushing up 
prices. Additionally, periods of intense rainfall 
could restrict access to coal-producing regions and 
facilities, as observed in Australia and Indonesia in 
2025H1, contributing to short-term supply 
constraints and price increases. 
Upside risk: Higher-than-expected electricity 
demand from data centers 
As noted in the discussion of natural gas, a faster-
than-expected expansion in data center construc-
tion could place a sustained pressure on electricity 
markets. Coal demand in the power sector could 
rise as a result, especially in China and the United 
States, where domestic production could help 
offset any shortfall in power generation. 
Downside risk: Higher-than-expected supply 
Uncertainty remains as to whether the supply 
reductions assumed in the baseline will material-
ize. In China coal production could increase, 
unless safety inspections targeting excess produc-
tion have a long-lasting impact. U.S. production 
could continue increasing, if coal suppliers benefit 
from higher natural gas prices—a key substitute of 
coal in power generation—as occurred in 2025Q1 
(figure 9.D). U.S. supply could also benefit from 
federal policies aimed at increasing domestic coal 
production.  
Downside risk: Subdued economic activity 
Prices may fall below projections if economic 
growth is weaker than anticipated, particularly in 
China and India, which together account for 
approximately 70 percent of global coal demand. 
In China, the recent slowdown in industrial 
activity and infrastructure investment could prove 
to be more intense and prolonged than currently 
expected. 
Global coal consumption is expected to fluctuate 
throughout the forecast period (figure 9.B). 
Electricity demand is set to rise in China, India, 
and the United States due to greater use of electric 
vehicles (EVs), air conditioning, and expanding 
data centers. However, higher output from 
renewable electricity plants—especially in China 
and India—will moderate coal demand growth. 
Among the major coal consumers, demand in 
2026 and 2027 is expected to increase only in 
China and India. In 2026, declines in the EU and 
the United States are expected to outweigh 
increases in China and India. 
Global coal production is forecast to be lower in 
2026 than in 2025, contributing to a drawdown 
in existing coal stocks (figure 9.B). India is the 
only major coal producer expected to increase 
supply, albeit at a moderate rate. Production in 
China is expected to decrease starting in 2026. 
International coal trade is expected to edge lower 
in 2026, in line with falling imports in Asia. This 
will decrease exports from Australia and Indonesia, 
the two largest major exporters, and contribute to 
lower prices. 
Risks 
Risks to the coal price forecast are broadly bal-
anced. The most notable upside risks are unex-
pected increases in China’s coal consumption, 
more frequent or severe extreme weather events 
and higher-than-expected power demand from 
data centers. Downside risks include strong coal 
supply, and subdued demand resulting from 
weaker-than-expected economic activity. 
Upside risk: Unexpected increase in  
consumption in China 
The projection that global coal consumption will 
plateau through the forecast period is contingent 
upon stable demand in China. Rising electricity 
consumption driven by growing EV adoption 
presents a notable risk to this assumption. The 
record number of coal power plants permitted in 
2025Q1 underscores coal’s continuing—albeit 
gradually declining—role in the national power 
grid (figure 9.C).

Agriculture 
The World Bank Group’s agricultural commodity 
price index eased in October as seasonal harvests in 
the Northern Hemisphere and sizable supplies 
weighed on grains and some beverages. Earlier, the 
index fell by 4 percent in 2025Q3 (q/q)—its second 
consecutive quarterly decline—due to improved 
weather conditions in cocoa- and coffee-growing 
regions and an ample grain supply. The agricultural 
price index is projected to remain stable in 2025 
before edging down by 2 percent in 2026. Food and 
agricultural raw material prices are forecast to 
remain little changed in 2026, as supply growth 
keeps pace with demand, while beverage prices are 
expected to fall by 7 percent in 2026, owing to 
expanding supply. Risks to the forecast are broadly 
balanced, with upside risks from extreme weather 
events, reduced trade tensions involving several 
commodities with U.S. benchmarks (particularly 
soybeans), and higher-than-expected input costs such 
as natural gas for fertilizers offset by downside risks 
from weaker biofuel demand and more subdued 
global growth. 
Food commodities 
Recent developments 
Food commodity prices edged down in October as 
declines in grains and other foods were partly 
offset by gains in edible oils. Food prices fell by 1 
percent in 2025Q3 (q/q) and were 5 percent lower 
than a year earlier (figure 10.A). The year-on-year 
decrease reflects ample global supplies and favora-
ble growing conditions, led by a 12 percent 
decline in grain prices and a 6 percent drop in 
other foods, while oils and meals were little 
changed (figure 10.B).  
In October, rice prices fell to their lowest level 
since early 2017 due to subdued import demand 
amid abundant global supplies. Earlier, prices 
decreased by 10 percent in 2025Q3 (q/q) and by 
more than one-third from a year earlier. This 
sharp decline reflected record-high production, 
India’s removal of export restrictions, and a 5 
percent increase (y/y) in global ending stocks for 
2024-25, mainly among the major exporters—
India, Pakistan, Thailand, the United States, and 
Viet Nam (figure 10.C). Maize prices softened in 
October as the U.S. Midwest harvest progressed. 
Prices fell 7 percent in 2025Q3 amid seasonal 
harvests and improved supply but remained 8 
percent above levels a year earlier, after hotter and 
drier conditions in parts of South America had 
lifted prices in the first half of 2025. Wheat prices 
eased in October amid slower U.S. export ship-
ments, an upward revision to EU 2025-26 pro-
duction, and a pickup in Russian exports after a 
slow start. Prices declined 4 percent in 2025Q3 
and were 10 percent lower than a year earlier, 
reflecting an improved supply outlook, with global 
wheat production projected to reach a record in 
the 2025-26 crop year.  
The oils and meals price index rose by 2 percent in 
2025Q3 (q/q) and remained unchanged from a 
year earlier (figure 10.B). Soybean oil and palm oil 
prices both increased by 7 percent in 2025Q3, a 
trend that continued in October. The rise was 
supported by stronger domestic feedstock demand 
for biodiesel production—driven by higher 
admixture mandates in Brazil, plans to raise 
blending mandates in Indonesia, and the expira-
tion of tax credits for imported biofuels in the 
United States. Higher demand from major edible 
oil importers to restock depleted inventories 
provided additional support for prices. In contrast, 
increased crushing of soybeans into oil prompted 
by low soybean prices and tight alternative oilseed 
supplies, boosted the supply of soybean meal (a  
co-product of soybean oil production) by 8 
percent in 2024-25, pushing its price 22 percent 
lower in the year to 2025Q3 (figure 10.D).  
Other food prices edged down in 2025Q3 (q/q) 
and were 6 percent lower than a year earlier, as 
declines in fruit and sugar prices outweighed gains 
in beef. Sugar prices fell by 6 percent (q/q) to 15 
percent lower than a year earlier, with further 
declines in October, driven by strong production 
in Brazil and expectations of a global surplus in 
2025-26. In contrast, beef prices in the United 
States—a benchmark market for both beef and 
chicken—rose 2 percent in the quarter and 9 
percent from four quarters earlier. U.S. cattle 
inventories dropped to their lowest since 1951, 
reflecting long-term shifts toward chicken con-
sumption and greater reliance on imports. Beef

price pressures were compounded by prolonged 
Midwest drought conditions and a U.S. ban on 
livestock imports from Mexico imposed for disease 
control reasons. Chicken prices eased 2 percent in 
2025Q3 but remained 25 percent higher than in 
2024Q3, after sharp increases earlier in 2025 
linked to efforts to contain bird flu outbreaks. 
FIGURE 10 Agricultural prices 
Agricultural commodity prices fell by 4 percent in 2025Q3 (q/q), driven by 
a 10 percent drop in beverage prices. Raw material prices declined by 
nearly 3 percent in the quarter, while food prices eased by 1 percent. 
Among food groups, a 6 percent decline in grain prices, due to ample 
global supplies, was partially offset by a 2 percent increase in oil seeds 
and meals, reflecting stronger demand for edible oils in biodiesel 
production. The agricultural price index is projected to decline by 2 
percent in 2026, led by a further 7 percent drop in beverage prices, while 
other components are expected to remain broadly stable. Agricultural 
prices are forecast to be largely unchanged in 2027.

Outlook 
Following an estimated 6 percent decline in 2025, 
the food price index is projected to remain broadly 
stable in 2026 and 2027, with annual prices for all 
three components—grains, oils and meals, and 
other foods—expected to remain within 1-2 
percent of the previous year’s levels (figures 10.E 
and 10.F).  
Global grain supply growth is envisaged to return 
to its long-term annual trend in 2025-26, with 
stocks-to-use ratios (a measure of supply relative to 
demand) projected to inch down only slightly for 
major grains (figures 11.A and 11.B). After a 31 
percent decline in 2025, following a strong harvest 
and the easing of export restrictions, rice prices are 
forecast to dip by a further 1 percent in 2026, as 
supply growth slightly outpaces consumption. In 
2027, however, rice prices are expected to rise by 2 
percent, 
reflecting 
a 
likely 
contraction 
in 
production due to decade-low prices and increasing 
consumption amid continued population growth 
in Asia and Africa.  
Wheat prices, which are projected to fall by 7 
percent in 2025, are forecast to rise by 4 percent in 
both 2026 and 2027. Global wheat production in 
the 2025-26 season is expected to rise by 1 
percent, slower than consumption growth, with 
end-season stocks projected to decline by 2 percent 
to a seven-year low. Maize prices, which are 
estimated to increase by 4 percent in 2025, are 
forecast to edge down in 2026 before rising 
modestly in 2027. Global maize production in the 
2025-26 season is expected to grow by 5 percent 
to an all-time high, but with rising consumption 
and low opening stocks, overall supply is projected 
to only marginally surpass demand (figure 11.B).  
The oils and meals price index is forecast to 
decline by 3 percent in 2025, with a 12 percent 
drop in the price of soybeans and a 21 percent 
plunge in soybean meal prices, partly offset by 
gains in the prices of soybean oil (13 percent) and 
palm oil (6 percent). The index is projected to 
remain essentially unchanged in 2026-27, as 
balanced growth in edible oil supply and 
consumption keeps stocks-to-use ratios stable 
(figures 11.C and 11.D). The 2025 decline in 
soybean prices is expected to prompt a 1 percent

FIGURE 11 Supply conditions for grains and edible oils  
Global grain supply is forecast to increase in the 2025-26 crop year, in line 
with its historical average, with stocks-to-use ratios for most grains 
expected to decline only marginally. Edible oil supply is also projected to 
strengthen broadly in line with its historical average, but stronger demand 
growth is expected to reduce stocks-to-use ratios for soybeans and 
soybean oil.

A.C. Supply is the sum of beginning stocks and production and excludes imports. 
A. Grains include barley, maize, rice, oats, rye, sorghum, and wheat. 
C. Edible oils include coconut, cottonseed, palm, palm kernel, peanut, rapeseed, soybean, and 
sunflower seed oil. 
B.D. Stocks-to-use ratio is the ratio of domestic consumption to end-season stocks.  
weather events; and higher fertilizer costs. Key 
downside risks include weaker-than-anticipated 
biofuel demand and a sharper-than-expected 
slowdown in global economic growth.  
Upside risk: Reduced trade tensions  
Trade tensions between the United States and 
China have widened price gaps and strengthened 
trade diversion in global soybean markets. U.S. 
soybeans trade at a discount to those in Brazil, but 
China’s retaliatory tariffs prevent Chinese buyers 
from capitalizing on lower U.S. prices (figure 
12.A). As a result, China has increased imports 
from Brazil, while other buyers have shifted 
toward U.S. soybeans. If tensions ease and trade 
normalizes, soybean prices in the United States, 
the benchmark market, could rise above forecasts.

contraction in global soybean planting area during 
the 2025-26 season. With global consumption 
projected to reach a new high in 2025-26 and 
tight year-end inventories, soybean prices are 
forecast to increase by 1 percent in 2026 and 2 
percent in 2027.  
Soybean oil consumption is projected to rise by 
3.0 million metric tons (4 percent) in 2025-26, 
outpacing expected supply growth of 1.8 million 
tons. This deficit is set to push prices slightly 
higher in 2026. However, prices are forecast to 
decline modestly in 2027 as improving sunflower 
oil supplies ease upward pressure on soybean oil 
prices. Palm oil production in 2025-26 is 
envisaged to grow at about half the pace of the 
2015-24 average, while demand is expected to 
remain 
strong 
owing 
to 
improved 
price 
competitiveness relative to alternative oils. As a 
result, palm oil prices are forecast to rise by 3 
percent in 2026 and edge up in 2027. Soybean 
meal prices, after a projected 21 percent decline in 
2025, are expected to fall by 4 percent in 2026, 
driven by increased soybean oil production, which 
raises meal supply as a co-product. In 2027, 
however, soybean meal prices are expected to 
strengthen by 2 percent, as rising reliance on 
sunflower oil reduces soybean oil demand and 
production, thereby tightening soybean meal 
supply. 
The other foods price index is projected to decline 
by 6 percent in 2025 and 1 percent in 2026 before 
edging up by 1 percent in 2027. Beef and chicken 
prices—after projected increases of 14 percent and 
16 percent, respectively, in 2025—are forecast to 
remain broadly stable in 2026 and 2027. The 
stability reflects an expected recovery in the size of 
the U.S. beef herd and a steady rise in chicken 
production, supported by favorable margins 
between feed costs and chicken prices. Sugar prices 
are envisaged to fall by 15 percent in 2025 and a 
further 3 percent in 2026 before stabilizing in 
2027, as global supply is projected to outpace 
consumption.  
Risks 
Risks to the food price outlook are broadly 
balanced. The main upside risks include reduced 
trade tensions, especially for soybeans; extreme

FIGURE 12 Risks to agricultural price projections  
U.S. soybean prices in 2025Q3 traded at a discount to Brazil’s amid 
ongoing trade tensions among major economies. A stronger or longer-
lasting La Niña than currently forecast could push agricultural prices 
above 
forecasts, 
as 
could 
higher-than-expected 
fertilizer 
costs. 
Conversely, weaker-than-expected demand growth for edible oils in the 
biofuel industry could push agricultural prices below baseline projections.

regions—including Argentina, southern Brazil, 
and the U.S. Gulf Coast—potentially compromis-
ing the production of maize, wheat, and soybeans 
and pushing prices above current forecasts. In 
other countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and 
the Philippines, a stronger-than-expected La Niña 
could cause flooding or landslides that disrupt the 
planting season for rice and other crops, potential-
ly increasing import demand.  
Upside risk: Higher-than-expected fertilizer 
costs 
Fertilizer prices are projected to rise by 21 percent 
in 2025 before declining in 2026 and 2027, an 
outlook predicated on the assumption that 
China’s export restrictions on nitrogen and 
phosphate fertilizers will ease (figure 12.C). If 
these restrictions are maintained, natural gas prices 
rise, or demand proves stronger than expected, 
fertilizer costs could remain elevated, pushing food 
prices above current forecasts. 
Downside risk: Weaker-than-expected biofuel 
demand  
Prices of edible oils have been supported by 
growth in their use as biodiesel feedstocks, particu-
larly in Brazil, Indonesia, and the United States 
(figure 12.D). This trend is expected to continue, 
but lower crude oil prices or softer blending 
mandates could reduce demand and lower prices.  
Downside risk: Weaker-than-expected global 
growth 
These baseline agricultural price forecasts assume 
broadly steady global economic growth in 2026-
27. However, risks to the global growth outlook 
remain tilted to the downside. Weaker-than-
expected global growth could lead to softer 
commodity demand and lower food prices—
particularly for edible oils and beef, which tend to 
exhibit higher elasticity with respect to global 
economic activity than other food commodities. 
Implications for food price inflation and food 
security  
In 2025Q3, the global median domestic food 
price inflation (from four quarters earlier) stood at 
3.3 percent in local currency terms, down from 
3.7 percent in the previous quarter. Four-quarter

occurrence of a La Niña event in late 2025 or 
early 2026 (figure 12.B).7 If La Niña proves

inflation picked up in advanced economies, from 
3.6 percent in 2025Q2 to 3.8 percent in 2025Q3, 
but declined in EMDEs, from 3.9 percent to 2.9 
percent. Regionally, four-quarter food inflation 
was highest in Europe and Central Asia, at 7.1 
percent, accelerating from 2025Q2. Food inflation 
remained elevated in Sub-Saharan Africa and 
South Asia, though it moderated in Q3 compared 
with the previous quarter (figure 13.A).  
The number of people facing hunger globally is 
projected to decline to 634 million in 2025, from 
673 million in 2024, according to the UN Food 
and Agriculture Organization. Falling 2025 prices 
for staples—especially rice and wheat—likely 
improved basic food affordability in EMDEs, 
though conflicts and domestic economic condi-
tions often limit and unevenly transmit global 
price declines to domestic markets. However, the 
world remains off track in achieving the Sustaina-
ble Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger by 
2030. Given that the number of people facing 
hunger rose by 150 million between 2018 and 
2021, it would take two more years of progress at 
currently-projected rates to return to the 2015 
level of global hunger—the year the SDGs were 
adopted (figure 13.B).  
Beverages  
After reaching record highs in early 2025, in 
response to weather-related shortfalls in cocoa and 
coffee production, the World Bank Group’s 
beverages price index fell by 10 percent in 
2025Q3 (q/q). The decline reflected continued 
drops in coffee and cocoa prices related to recover-
ies in production, while tea prices rose modestly. 
After a projected 18 percent increase in 2025, the 
index is expected to fall by 7 percent in 2026 and 
5 percent in 2027 as supply continues to expand. 
Coffee prices declined by 10 percent in 2025Q3 
(q/q), easing from weather-related spikes earlier in 
the year, as supplies improved and demand growth 
remained solid (figure 14.A). Arabica prices fell by 
nearly 5 percent and Robusta prices by 15 percent 
in 2025Q3. Global coffee production, which 
reached 174 million bags in the 2024-25 season, is 
expected to rise to 179 million bags in 2025-26 
(figure 14.B). Following a nearly 50 percent 
increase in 2025 (y/y), Arabica prices are projected

second-largest Arabica producer, recovers. Robusta 
prices are projected to rise by 9 percent in 2025 
but to fall by 2 percent in both 2026 and 2027. 
Upside risks to the forecasts include weather-
related supply disruptions, particularly in Brazil, 
the leading global producer, and the potential 
impact of new U.S. tariffs on coffee imports from 
Brazil. 
Cocoa prices fell by 14 percent in 2025Q3 (q/q) 
but remained 7 percent higher than a year earlier 
(figure 14.C). The easing of prices reflects an 
improved outlook for the 2025-26 crop season in 
West Africa, as global production is projected to 
rebound by more than 10 percent, driven by 
increases of 5 percent in Côte d’Ivoire, the largest 
producer, and 34 percent in Ghana. The expected 
rebound follows a production decline in the 2024-
25 season due to unfavorable weather conditions 
(figure 14.D). Cocoa prices are projected to rise by 
9 percent in 2025 (y/y) but to fall by 6 percent in 
2026 and 7 percent in 2027 as supplies expand.

weather-related developments, particularly if La 
Niña conditions in West Africa prove more 
favorable to production than expected. 
Tea prices (three-auction average) rose by 1 
percent in 2025Q3 (q/q) but remained 8 percent 
lower than a year earlier (figure 14.E). Weather-
related supply constraints and strong demand for 
high-grade tea pushed up prices at the Colombo 
and Mombasa auctions, while prices at the Kolka-
ta auction slipped due to seasonal factors. Despite 
localized supply concerns in Kenya and Uganda, 
the global tea market remains well supplied, partly 
owing to higher output from Sri Lanka (figure 
14.F). After a projected 5 percent decline in 2025, 
tea prices are expected to recover by nearly 2 
percent in both 2026 and 2027, supported by 
higher production in both South Asia and East 
Africa. 
Agricultural raw materials 
The World Bank Group’s agricultural raw materi-
als price index fell by 3 percent in 2025Q3 (q/q), 
with modest gains in cotton and natural rubber 
offset by declines in timber and other materials. 
The index is expected to rise by more than 2 
percent in 2025 before declining in 2026 and 
2027, reflecting strong global supply prospects 
and softening demand. 
Cotton prices were broadly stable through the first 
three quarters of 2025, although they were down 
by half from the 2022 peak (figure 15.A). This 
stabilization reflects supply growth during the 
2024-25 crop year, when global production rose 6 
percent, alongside stronger-than-expected de-
mand. Global cotton production is expected to fall 
by 2 percent in the 2025-26 season, according to 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s latest 
assessment, with sharp declines in Australia (27 
percent), Türkiye (9 percent), and the United 
States (8 percent). Together with China and India, 
these producers account for more than two-thirds 
of global output. Global consumption of cotton is 
projected to remain broadly stable, leaving the 
stocks-to-use ratio at 0.63 (figure 15.B). Following 
an 11 percent decline in 2025 (y/y), cotton prices 
are expected to rebound by about 3 percent 
annually in both 2026 and 2027. Key risks to the 
FIGURE 14 Beverage markets  
Beverage prices eased in 2025Q3 from their record high earlier in the year, 
as coffee and cocoa prices fell, while tea prices remained broadly stable 
owing to ample supplies. The beverage price index is projected to decline 
by 7 percent in 2026 and an additional 5 percent in 2027, reflecting 
favorable prospects for coffee and cocoa production. Key risks to the 
outlook include weather-related disruptions to production and more- 
severe-than-assumed effects of U.S. tariffs on Brazil’s coffee exports than 
assumed.

FIGURE 15 Agricultural raw materials markets  
The agricultural raw material price index fell by 3 percent in 2025Q3, with 
declines in the prices of timber and other products outweighing moderate 
gains in natural rubber prices. Cotton prices remained broadly stable, 
supported by strong supply growth in the 2024-25 crop year. Natural 
rubber prices edged up in 2025Q3, following earlier declines from record 
highs, amid weather-related supply concerns in key producing regions and 
uncertainty over trade restrictions. After increasing by around 2 percent in 
2025, the index is projected to ease in 2026 and 2027, reflecting strong 
global supply prospects and subdued demand.

A. Monthly data. Last observation is September 2025. 
B. Year spans indicate crop seasons. Stocks-to-use ratio is the ratio of domestic consumption to  
end-season stocks. Data updated as of October 17, 2025. 
price outlook include weaker-than-expected global 
economic growth, which would dampen demand, 
and adverse weather conditions in key producing 
regions, which would reduce supply. 
Natural rubber prices rose by 2 percent in 
2025Q3 (q/q) in response to concerns over trade 
restrictions and weather-related supply disruptions 
in Southeast Asia, following heavy seasonal rains 
in Malaysia and Thailand. However, in the 12 
months to September 2025, global production 
rose by 4.7 percent, led by Indonesia (11 percent), 
Malaysia and Côte d’Ivoire (about 8 percent each), 
and Thailand (5 percent), the world’s largest 
producer. Demand for natural rubber increased by 
2 percent in the year to September 2025. Tire 
production, which accounts for nearly two-thirds 
of natural rubber use, changed little for light 
vehicles and fell slightly for heavy vehicles, under-
scoring sluggish automotive demand. Natural 
rubber prices are projected to remain broadly 
unchanged in 2025 before rising by 2 percent in 
2026 and 3 percent in 2027. Risks to the forecast 
are skewed to the downside and include a sharper-
than-expected slowdown in global automobile 
production amid recently imposed tariffs and 
persistent overcapacity in China’s auto sector. 
Fertilizers  
The World Bank Group’s fertilizer price index 
jumped by almost 14 percent in 2025Q3 (q/q)—the 
fifth consecutive quarterly increase—to a level 28 
percent higher than a year earlier. Urea, TSP (triple 
superphosphate), and DAP (diammonium phos-
phate) have all recorded sharp gains, while MOP 
(muriate of potash, or potassium chloride) was 
marginally lower following strong increases in the 
previous two quarters. The overall increase reflects 
strong demand, trade restrictions, and some produc-
tion shortfalls—especially in the case of urea. The 
fertilizer price index is projected to rise by 21 percent 
in 2025 before easing in 2026 and 2027, albeit to 
levels well above the 2015-19 average. Prices are 
expected to remain elevated due to raised input costs 
(especially for nitrogen), resilient consumption, and 
trade restrictions and sanctions affecting producers. 
Key risks include higher input costs on the upside and 
increased exports from China on the downside. 
Recent developments  
After briefly falling to pre-pandemic levels in 
December 2024, fertilizer prices have increased 
markedly over the past three quarters, though they 
eased in October (figure 16.A). Urea prices rose 
43 percent in the year to 2025Q3, partly due to 
strong import demand and restocking in India, 
while DAP (diammonium phosphate) and TSP 
(triple superphosphate) surged 41 and 31 percent, 
respectively. MOP increased 22 percent. Com-
bined with weaker agricultural commodity prices, 
these increases have eroded farmers’ profit mar-
gins. The DAP affordability index (the price of 
DAP relative to food) is now well above its 
previous peak in early 2022 (figure 16.B). 
Some input costs have moderated in recent 
months. Natural gas prices—a critical input for 
nitrogen fertilizer production—fell by 26 percent 
in the United States and 16 percent in Europe (in 
U.S. dollar terms) during January-September 
2025. Ammonia prices have also declined sharply. 
By contrast, liquid sulphur prices have tripled 
since end-2024 (figure 16.C).

subject to EU trade sanctions. More recently, the 
EU introduced tariffs on agricultural imports, 
including nitrogen fertilizers, from Russia and 
Belarus in turn causing a rerouting of these 
fertilizers to Asia and the Americas. 
Outlook and risks 
The fertilizer price index is expected to increase by 
more than 20 percent in 2025, reflecting stronger 
demand and supply constraints stemming from 
trade restrictions, before declining in 2026 and 
2027. Urea prices are projected to rise by 30 
percent in 2025 amid tighter market conditions, 
before easing by 7 percent in 2026 and 9 percent 
in 2027 as new capacity in East Asia and the 
Middle East comes online. A modest recovery in 
European production of urea may also occur, 
offsetting the shortfall of imports from Russia. 
This follows a long period of subdued output due 
to the loss of natural gas flows after Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine. Upside risks to the baseline 
price forecast include slower capacity expansion, 
renewed trade restrictions, and higher natural gas 
prices. In the longer term, there are structural 
challenges to the supply of nitrogen fertilizers—
given their high carbon footprint—which could 
accelerate a shift toward lower-emission alterna-
tives such as biofertilizers, organic amendments, 
and regenerative farming technologies. 
DAP prices are forecast to increase by 26 percent 
in 2025 before falling by 8 percent in 2026 and 
again in 2027, as new capacity eases supply 
pressures. The forecast assumes that Russia will 
continue diverting exports from Europe to Brazil 
and India, although additional export restrictions, 
supply disruptions, or spikes in ammonia or 
natural gas prices could push DAP prices higher. 
MOP prices are expected to rise by 19 percent in 
2025 amid firm demand, followed by moderate 
declines in 2026 and 2027. A key downside risk is 
a faster-than-expected expansion of Belarusian 
exports through alternative routes. 
FIGURE 16 Fertilizer markets

superphosphate (TSP) and diammonium phosphate (DAP) amid strong 
demand, trade restrictions, and production shortfalls. The fertilizer price

moderating over the next two years. Risks to the outlook include higher

downside.

Trade policies and sanctions continue to reshape

been constrained, particularly by China’s discre-
tionary export restrictions: in 2024, the country’s 
nitrogen fertilizer exports fell by more than 90 
percent (y/y) as authorities prioritized domestic 
price stability and supply security (figure 16.D). 
These restrictions extended well into 2025. 
Phosphate exports have also been curbed by China 
to secure inputs for lithium-iron-phosphate 
batteries used in electric vehicles. Meanwhile,

introduction of U.S. tariffs earlier in the year. 
Despite subdued activity in major economies, 
aluminum demand growth is expected to remain 
resilient, underpinned by its critical role in renew-
able energy technologies such as solar and wind 
power and expanding electricity grid infrastruc-
ture. On the supply side, aluminum output 
growth is projected to moderate as China, which 
accounts for 60 percent of global production, 
approaches the output ceiling it introduced in 
2017 to contain emissions. In Europe, primary 
aluminum production is gradually recovering from 
smelter closures triggered by high energy costs 
following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, though 
output remains about 15 percent below 2019-21 
levels. Further recovery will likely be limited by 
environmental regulations and scarce affordable 
aluminum scrap. Following an estimated 7 percent 
increase in 2025 (y/y), aluminum prices are 
expected to rise modestly by 1 percent in 2026 
and a further 4 percent in 2027, supported by 
steady demand growth amid tighter supply 
conditions. 
Copper prices rose by 3 percent in 2025Q3 (q/q), 
to a 16-month high and have continued to climb 
in October. The third quarter increase reflected 
surging U.S. imports ahead of tariffs as well as 
output disruptions at a major Indonesian copper 
mine. Copper demand is expected to expand only 
modestly over the next two years, as subdued 
global activity and continued weakness in China’s 
property sector weigh on consumption. Tese 
headwinds are anticipated to be partly oﬀset by 
growing use of copper in renewable energy tech-
nologies—including electric vehicles (EVs), power 
grids, and data centers—as well as by increasing 
defense spending and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)-
related infrastructure. On the supply side, global 
production is also expected to increase modestly, 
as operational setbacks at several large mines 
constrain near-term output growth. After an 
expected 6 percent increase in 2025 (y/y), copper 
prices are projected to rise by 1 percent in 2026 
and 2 percent in 2027, reaching new all-time 
highs in annual terms, reﬂecting broadly balanced 
demand and supply conditions.  
Lead prices edged up by 1 percent in 2025Q3 (q/
q) and have remained broadly stable in October. 
Metals and Minerals 
Metal prices rose by 4 percent in 2025Q3 (q/q), and 
continued to climb in October, supported by firm 
global metal demand. After an expected 3 percent 
increase in 2025 (y/y), metal and mineral prices are 
projected to remain steady in 2026 before edging up 
2 percent in 2027, supported by modest demand 
growth amid tightening supply conditions. Precious 
metal prices are expected to increase by 41 percent in 
2025 as a whole, driven by gains in gold and silver, 
with smaller gains of 6 percent projected for 2026, 
before easing by 6 percent in 2027. Risks to the price 
outlook for base metals are tilted to the downside. 
Most prominently, weaker-than-expected growth in 
major economies could dampen metal demand and 
push prices below baseline projections. Upside risks to 
the price forecast for base metals include production 
disruptions, new trade restrictions, and faster-than-
expected expansion of data centers. For precious 
metals, further escalation of geopolitical tensions or 
policy uncertainty could lift gold and silver prices 
above forecasts. 
Base metals and iron ore 
Recent developments and outlook  
Metal prices rebounded in 2025Q3 and rose 
further in October, driven mainly by aluminum 
and copper, following a decline in the previous 
quarter (figures 17.A and 17.B). The recovery 
reflects resilient activity in major economies. 
Rising renewable energy investment and related 
infrastructure projects, especially in China, 
continue to support demand for aluminum, 
copper, and tin, among other metals. Nonetheless, 
the weakness in China’s property sector remains a 
major drag on demand for construction-related 
metals such as iron ore—the key input for steel—
and zinc. More broadly, persistent cyclical head-
winds, including subdued global activity, will 
constrain base metal prices during the forecast 
period. Base metal prices are projected to hold 
steady in 2026 and inch higher in 2027, while 
iron ore prices are forecast to decline in both years 
(figure 17.C). 
Aluminum prices rose by 7 percent in 2025Q3 (q/
q) and have extended their gains in October, 
recovering from the sharp drop that followed the

vehicle sales and battery replacements, partly oﬀset 
by growing EV adoption. Global mine production 
is projected to rise moderately over the forecast 
horizon, reﬂecting new developments—some 
linked to other metals—in several countries, 
including North and South America. Meanwhile, 
reﬁned lead recycling—which accounts for about 
two-thirds of total supply—is also expected to 
increase, keeping overall availability broadly in line 
with demand. After an expected 5 percent decline 
in 2025 (y/y), lead prices are projected to remain 
steady in 2026 and inch higher by 1 percent in 
2027, reﬂecting a broadly balanced market (ﬁgure 
17.D). 
Nickel prices edged down by 1 percent in 2025Q3 
(q/q), extending the weakness of the previous 
quarter amid ample supply and were broadly 
unchanged in October. Global production is 
expected to expand steadily over the forecast 
horizon, with most of the growth occurring in 
Indonesia, which accounts for about 60 percent of 
global output. Indonesia’s plan to revert to one-
year (from three-year) production quotas is 
intended to strengthen oversight and support 
prices, but the impact on the still-oversupplied 
global market is envisaged to be limited, with the 
surplus projected to narrow only gradually. On the 
demand side, stainless steel production—which 
accounts for about two-thirds of nickel demand—
is expected to provide only modest support amid 
subdued global activity. Demand is also set to 
beneﬁt from continued EV adoption, where nickel 
is a key input for nickel-rich EV batteries, particu-
larly in China, despite the growing use of nickel-
free lithium-iron-phosphate batteries. Against this 
backdrop, after falling by an estimated 9 percent 
in 2025 (y/y), nickel prices are projected to 
increase by 1 percent in 2026 and by a further 3 
percent in 2027 as the demand-supply balance 
gradually tightens (ﬁgure 17.E). 
Tin prices rose by 5 percent in 2025Q3 (q/q) and 
have continued to climb in October, supported by 
ﬁrming industrial activity. Tin is primarily used in 
solder, most of which goes into electronics and 
semiconductors. Global tin supply is expected to 
strengthen over the forecast horizon, driven by 
higher exports from Indonesia—following the end 
of licensing delays that had impeded exports since 
FIGURE 17 Metals and minerals markets  
Base metal prices increased in 2025Q3, reflecting resilience in major 
economies despite ongoing headwinds, with gains driven mainly by 
aluminum and copper. After rising by an expected 2 percent in 2025, metal 
and mineral prices are projected to remain broadly stable in 2026 before 
edging higher in 2027. Downside risks to the outlook dominate: weaker-
than-expected growth in major economies, particularly in China, could 
cause prices to undershoot forecasts. Upside risks include unexpected 
supply 
disruptions—potentially 
stemming 
from 
additional 
trade 
restrictions—and stronger-than-expected stimulus measures.

2024—and the anticipated restart of major mines 
in Myanmar that have been idle since 2023. 
Despite these near-term gains in output, the global 
tin market is likely to remain tight, given the 
limited pipeline of new projects and continued 
vulnerability to geopolitical and operational 
disruptions. On the demand side, growth is 
projected to remain resilient, underpinned by 
increases in the production of semiconductors, 
photovoltaic panels, and other energy-transition 
technologies. Against this backdrop, after rising by 
an estimated 10 percent in 2025, tin prices are 
forecast to increase by 3 percent in 2026 and a 
further 2 percent in 2027, bringing prices to new 
record annual highs. 
Zinc prices increased by 7 percent in 2025Q3 (q/
q) and increased further in October, rebounding 
from 7 percent declines in the two previous 
quarters amid a tighter supply-demand balance. 
Zinc consumption is closely tied to autos, manu-
facturing, and construction, as it is used mainly 
for galvanizing steel—particularly in China, which 
is the world’s largest consumer. Zinc demand 
growth is expected to slow in 2026-27 as China’s 
economy continues to decelerate, with continued 
weakness in the property sector weighing on steel 
demand and galvanizing activity. Some support for 
demand will come from infrastructure and power 
grid investment, as well as renewable energy 
applications, but these are unlikely to fully oﬀset 
prevailing headwinds. After reﬁned zinc produc-
tion declined in the ﬁrst half of 2025, it is ex-
pected to expand over the next two years as rising 
mine output in major producing countries—
including China, which is also the world’s largest 
producer—gradually feeds through to reﬁned zinc 
supply (ﬁgure 17.F). With global supply steadily 
improving and demand growth subdued, zinc 
prices are projected to remain broadly stable in 
2025 (y/y) before declining by 2 percent in 2026 
and 2027. 
Iron ore prices rose by 5 percent in 2025Q3 (q/q) 
and increased further in October, rebounding 
from a 6 percent decline in the previous quarter. 
Te third-quarter recovery was supported by a 
temporary rebound in Chinese steel production 
(where iron ore is the key input) and by optimism 
over expectations of record-high steel exports this 
year. However, continued weakness in China’s 
property sector and subdued construction activity 
elsewhere are expected to weigh on iron ore 
demand. On the supply side, rising output from 
Australia and Brazil—the world’s two largest 
producers—together with additional low-cost  
high-grade supply from West Africa, is expected to 
add further downward pressure on prices. Iron ore 
prices are projected to decline by 10 percent in 
2025 (y/y), followed by further decreases of 4 
percent in 2026 and 2027. 
Risks 
Risks to the baseline forecast for metals and 
minerals prices are tilted to the downside. Te 
most signiﬁcant risk is weaker-than-expected 
global economic growth—particularly weaker 
growth in China, which accounts for about half of 
global base metal consumption. Weaker global 
growth would weigh heavily on demand, given the 
close links between investment and durable goods 
consumption and metals prices. On the upside, 
unexpected production disruptions or new trade 
restrictions could tighten supply, while a faster-
than-anticipated expansion of data centers would 
bolster demand—particularly for metals critical to 
the energy transition—and drive prices above 
baseline projections.  
Downside risk: Weaker-than-expected global 
growth  
Several forces could lead to weaker-than-expected 
global growth over the forecast horizon. Increased 
geopolitical tensions, resurgent trade frictions, and 
elevated policy uncertainty could weigh heavily on 
consumer and business confidence and thus 
private sector spending and activity. Metals 
demand and prices could then weaken dispropor-
tionately, given their close ties to investment and 
durable goods consumption. Relatedly, if the 
slowdown in China deepens, with more severe 
weakness in the property sector or negative effects 
on export-oriented manufacturing from higher 
tariffs or other trade restrictions, base metal 
demand and prices could face even larger declines. 
Upside risk: Production disruptions 
Metal production remains vulnerable to sudden 
interruptions from labor disputes, energy or water

tin export taxes, have also affected supply and 
trade flows. Although markets have largely adjust-
ed to these restrictions, any additional restrictions 
could disrupt supply chains, push prices above 
projections, and increase price volatility. 
Upside risk: Faster-than-expected expansion of 
data centers  
A faster-than-expected buildout of AI-related data 
centers and supporting power infrastructure could 
raise metal demand and prices above baseline 
projections, particularly for metals such as alumi-
num and copper. Large investment plans an-
nounced in major economies, including China 
and the United States, could advance more rapidly 
than currently anticipated, reflecting rising 
demand to expand AI computing capacity. Data 
centers require a substantial amount of metals for 
cooling, power distribution, renewable-energy 
integration, and structural support. If construction 
accelerates or scales up beyond expectations, 
already tight supply-demand balances could 
intensify, posing an upside risk to prices of several 
metals, including aluminum and copper.  
Other critical minerals  
Te prices of other critical minerals climbed 
higher in 2025Q3 (q/q), led by a 31 percent jump 
in rare earth metals, followed by gains of 21 
percent in cobalt and 18 percent in lithium (figure 
18.A). Cobalt prices strengthened further in 
October, while lithium and rare-earth prices edged 
lower. The surge in rare earth prices in recent 
months has occurred amid escalating trade ten-
sions between China and the United States. 
Lithium prices spiked in July after China tight-
ened regulations on mining rights and permits. 
Cobalt prices also rose sharply following the 
Democratic Republic of Congo’s announcement 
of an export ban earlier in the year. The govern-
ment subsequently extended the restrictions into 
2025Q3, with plans to transition to an export 
quota system. 
Critical mineral prices are expected to stay well 
below their 2022 levels in the near term, despite 
recent upward pressure from trade restrictions, as 
investment in expanding supply continues in 
anticipation of future demand from the energy 
FIGURE 18 Critical minerals markets  
Critical mineral prices rose sharply in 2025Q3, led by strong gains in rare 
earths, lithium, and cobalt, reflecting escalating trade restrictions between 
major economies. While these increases underscore the sector’s 
vulnerability to policy and geopolitical shocks, near-term prices are 
expected to remain contained as exploration and investment continue to 
expand. Over the longer term, however, sustained growth in demand from 
clean energy systems, electronics, artificial intelligence infrastructure, and 
defense technologies is expected to outpace supply, leaving markets 
structurally tight and supply chains vulnerable to disruption.

shortages, and extreme weather events. Any of 
these operational challenges could push prices 
higher than expected in the baseline, particularly 
for aluminum, copper, and tin, as supplies of these 
metals, critical for the energy transition, rely 
heavily on a limited number of producers. Output 
of base metals may also be constrained by unex-
pected regulatory changes and policy shifts. Such 
measures, including efforts to strengthen govern-
ance 
and 
environmental 
standards—notably 
recent actions in Indonesia’s tin sector to curb 
illegal mining and raise royalties—could also 
weigh on production. 
Upside risk: Commodity-speciﬁc trade  
restrictions 
Restrictions on metals trade have increased in 
recent years. They include the 50 percent U.S. 
tariff on imports of semi-finished copper products 
that took effect in August 2025, as well as new 
U.S. tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, 
announced earlier in the year. In addition, a U.S. 
Department of Commerce review of copper 
imports expected by June 2026 could trigger 
phased tariffs on imports of refined copper in 
2027 and 2028. Other measures, such as Europe-
an Union curbs on imports of Russian aluminum, 
Indonesia’s nickel ore export ban, and Myanmar’s

been driven largely by investment demand, 
supported by a combination of geopolitical 
tensions, macroeconomic concerns, and height-
ened policy uncertainty, reinforced by a weaker 
U.S. dollar and recent U.S. monetary policy easing 
(figure 19.A). Global gold demand rose by 13 
percent in 2025H1 (y/y), driven by a 117-percent 
surge in investment-related demand, primarily 
reflecting large inflows into gold-backed ETFs 
(figure 19.B). In contrast, demand from central 
banks and other institutions—a key source of 
support in recent years—as well as from jewelry 
fabrication, declined in 2025H1 (y/y). On the 
supply side, both mine production and recycled 
gold supply were broadly unchanged in the first 
half of 2025 (figure 19.C). This follows a slight 
decline in mine output and an 11 percent increase 
in recycled gold in 2024. Recycled supply is 
expected to continue rising modestly over the 
forecast horizon, while higher prices are likely to 
spur increased investment in mine production.  
Gold prices are expected to increase by 42 percent 
in 2025 (y/y). The last major surge occurred in 
1979-80, when gold prices almost doubled amid 
soaring U.S. inflation, oil price shocks, a weaken-
ing dollar, and geopolitical turmoil, including 
conflicts in the Middle East and Afghanistan, 
which fueled safe-haven demand (figure 19.D). 
Gold’s current rally has again coincided with 
heightened geopolitical tensions and a weakening 
dollar, but unlike in 1979-80, inflation pressures 
and energy-market disruptions have been less 
intense. Instead, a key distinguishing feature has 
been the unprecedented pace of central bank 
purchases, which have more than doubled since 
2022 relative to the 2015-19 average.  
Following the sharp increase in 2025, gold prices 
are expected to rise more moderately—by 5 
percent 
in 
2026—supported 
by 
continued 
(though softening) central bank purchases and 
expectations of further U.S. monetary easing, 
amid still-elevated geopolitical tensions and policy 
uncertainty. Prices are then projected to decline by 
6 percent in 2027, partly reflecting a normaliza-
tion of ETF investment flows. Despite the antici-
pated moderation, prices are envisaged to remain 
more than 180 percent above their 2015-19 
average in 2026.  
transition (figure 18.B). Exploration activity is 
being supported by major policy initiatives, 
including the European Commission’s Critical 
Raw Materials Act and the U.S. Department of 
Energy’s new funding initiatives announced in 
August 2025 to expand domestic production, 
processing, and recycling of critical minerals. 
Nevertheless, over the longer term, prices are 
expected to rise as demand from clean energy 
systems, electronics, AI infrastructure, and ad-
vanced military technologies outpaces supply. 
Supply growth may be constrained by environ-
mental concerns, long mine-development lead 
times, shifting policy incentives, and trade re-
strictions. Mining and processing remain highly 
concentrated in a few countries, leaving supply 
chains particularly vulnerable to disruptions amid 
elevated trade tensions. 
Precious metals  
Recent developments and outlook 
Precious metal prices have surged to record highs 
in early October, adding to a 7 percent gain in 
2025Q3 (q/q), before edging down recently. Gold 
and silver led the rally, reaching all-time peaks, 
while platinum also posted strong gains. Gold 
prices are projected to remain elevated through 
2026-27, driven by safe-haven demand from  
gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and 
continued (though moderating) central bank 
purchases amid elevated geopolitical tensions. 
Silver prices are projected to reach an all-time high 
on steadily rising demand, while tight supply 
conditions will continue to support platinum 
prices. The World Bank Group’s precious metals 
price index is expected to increase by 41 percent in 
2025 (y/y) and a further 6 percent in 2026 before 
declining by 6 percent in 2027. Geopolitical 
tensions or policy uncertainty could cause gold 
prices to surpass current projections, while softer-
than-expected industrial activity in major econo-
mies may dampen silver and platinum demand, 
pulling prices below forecasts.  
Gold prices rose by 5 percent in 2025Q3 (q/q) and 
extended gains in early October to new record 
highs, but have since moved lower amid a stronger 
dollar and possibly some investors locking in gains 
after the sharp rally. The rally in recent months has

FIGURE 19 Precious metals markets 
Precious metal prices rose by 7 percent in 2025Q3 (q/q) and continued to 
climb in early October amid heightened geopolitical tensions. Gold and 
silver led the rally, with gold reaching record highs, driven by investment 
demand through gold-backed exchange-traded funds amid limited supply 
growth. Gold prices are expected to reach new highs in 2026, following a 
surge in 2025 reminiscent of the 1979-80 period. Silver prices are also 
expected to rise further, supported by their dual role as a safe-haven asset 
and a key input in energy transition technologies, while platinum prices are 
projected to strengthen amid persistent supply tightness. Further 
escalation of geopolitical tensions is a key upside risk for gold prices, while 
weaker-than-expected industrial activity in major economies remains a 
downside risk for silver and platinum.

forecasts  
Silver prices rose by 18 percent in 2025Q3 (q/q) 
and continued to surge to record highs in Octo-
ber. These gains were supported by renewed 
investor interest through silver-backed ETFs amid 
heightened geopolitical tensions and firm industri-
al demand, alongside low inventories at the 
London Metal Exchange (LME). Silver prices have 
since edged lower amid a broader market correc-
tion—similar to gold—and signs of easing supply 
concerns at the LME. Silver demand is projected 
to continue growing steadily, reflecting its dual 
role as a safe-haven asset and a critical input in  
fast-growing sectors such as renewable energy and 
the production of semiconductors. Industrial uses 
have accounted for almost 60 percent of recent 
silver demand, up from about 40 percent in 2015. 
In the near term, industrial manufacturing and 
installation of photovoltaic panels are expected to 
support demand, while heightened economic and 
geopolitical uncertainty may further strengthen 
safe-haven and ETF-related investment. On the 
supply side, availability is tight as mine production 
and recycled output growth are modest. On 
balance, demand growth is likely to continue 
outpacing supply growth, pushing prices up by an 
expected 34 percent in 2025 (y/y), followed by an 
8 percent increase in 2026. However, momentum 
is expected to ease thereafter, with prices projected 
to decline by 10 percent in 2027 as the ongoing 
surge in investment flows, including silver-backed 
ETFs, normalizes. 
Platinum prices rose by 31 percent in 2025Q3  
(q/q) and continued to increase in October, 
reflecting multiyear low production levels. De-
mand for platinum is expected to continue rising, 
albeit at a moderate pace. Growth in automotive 
use—mainly for catalytic converters, which 
account for nearly 40 percent of total demand—is 
likely to remain soft as EV penetration advances, 
while industrial and jewelry demand are projected 
to post only modest increases. Supply is projected 
to recover modestly from recent lows, with 
increases in mining output in South Africa—the 
world’s largest producer—and in recycling output 
from the auto and jewelry sectors. However, 
supply is expected to continue to fall short of 
demand. After rising by an expected 29 percent in 
2025 (y/y), prices are projected to increase by

4 percent in 2026 and a further 2 percent in 2027 
(figure 19.E).  
Risks  
Risks to the precious metals price outlook are 
tilted to the upside. Although geopolitical tensions 
and policy uncertainty have eased somewhat in 
recent months, any renewed escalation—through 
trade frictions, higher tariffs, or worsening con-
flicts—could trigger additional safe-haven inflows, 
pushing gold and silver prices above current 
projections. Unexpected financial volatility could 
also push precious metal prices higher. Stronger-
than-expected inflation, or a rise in inflation 
expectations alongside limited policy responses, 
could boost gold demand further as investors seek 
protection against eroding purchasing power. The 
outlook for gold remains subject to considerable 
uncertainty given gold’s high sensitivity to geopo-
litical developments and global economic condi-
tions (figure 19.F). This was exemplified by the 
recent pullback in prices, which coincided with a 
stronger U.S. dollar and likely reflected some 
profit-taking by investors after the sharp rally. 
Downside risks stem from a more hawkish U.S. 
monetary policy stance than currently expected, 
which would reduce gold’s investment appeal, or 
from faster-than-anticipated disinflation. A durable 
easing of geopolitical tensions could also curb safe-
haven demand, while weaker central bank pur-
chases would add to downward pressure. In 
addition, softer industrial demand—particularly 
from renewable technologies, if subsidies for solar 
panels, EV adoption, and other clean energy 
investments are scaled back more than expected—
could weigh on silver and platinum prices.

Introduction 
Recent commodity price volatility and risks to 
energy and food security—driven by escalating 
conflicts, geopolitical tensions, trade policy uncer-
tainty, pandemic-induced supply chain disrup-
tions, and shifts in energy use—have reignited 
interest in commodity supply management. 
Several proposals have been advanced. Following 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the estab-
lishment of strategic reserves of key commodi-
ties—where supply disruptions could pose serious 
economic risks, including oil, natural gas, wheat, 
potash, palladium, and copper—was proposed 
(Singh and Datta 2024). In the food sector, global 
reserves, both physical and virtual, have been 
widely discussed as a possible means of containing 
price surges, as seen in 2007-08 and 2010-11, and 
thus cushioning consumers (Von Braun and Tore-
ro 2008). A multilayered, internationally coordi-
nated buffer-stock system to support the green 
transformation of agriculture while enhancing 
global food security has also been proposed Weber 
and Schulken (2024). Policies to strengthen 
broader supply-chain resilience have been advocat-
ed (Alabi and Ngwenyama 2023).1 
Commodity price volatility, along with energy and food security concerns, has renewed interest in commodity 
supply and demand management. In the 20th century, producers from many countries sought to counter similar 
challenges through international agreements involving inventory controls, trade restrictions, and price-setting 
mechanisms. Eﬀorts after World War I and the Great Depression targeted commodities such as coﬀee, copper, 
tin, rubber, and sugar. Some provided temporary price stability, but most eventually collapsed. Post-World  
War II arrangements, involving both producers and consumers, focused on tropical commodities and metals, yet 
they too failed. Te most enduring agreement is in the oil market. Te Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries has been in eﬀect for 65 years, since 1960, yet it has repeatedly faced challenges from new supply 
sources and shifting consumer strategies, as well as eﬀorts to promote energy security and diversiﬁcation. 
Experience with these schemes oﬀers cautionary lessons. Coordinated interventions during acute supply 
disruptions can help stabilize prices temporarily, but sustained price-control measures are much more diﬃcult to 
maintain. More durable protection for producers and consumers could be achieved through continued reliance 
on market-based pricing; greater diversiﬁcation of production and consumption; increased eﬃciency, including 
through technological innovation; and improved data transparency. 
Note: This special focus is based on Baffes, Nagle, and Streifel 
(2024, 2025).  
1 Analysis of markets for critical minerals highlights their central 
role in energy diversification and vulnerability to geopolitical 
tensions. Proposals include a producer cartel (Harris 2023) and a 
Global Mineral Trust (Ali et al. 2025). The European Union has 
established a regulatory framework to diversify and secure supplies 
(EU 2024), while the United States is considering stockpiling 
strategies involving government and private actors (Moerenhout, 
Vazir, and Patrahau 2025).  
Many of the proposals are for policies similar to 
past 
international 
supply- 
and 
demand-
management schemes commonly referred to as 
international commodity agreements (ICAs). This 
special focus investigates experience with such 
agreements by considering three questions: 
• 
What has been the experience with non-oil 
commodity agreements and cartels? 
• 
What has been the experience with oil agree-
ments? 
• 
What policy lessons can be drawn from expe-
rience for current proposals?  
The analysis makes three main contributions, 
building on earlier analyses of commodity price 
behavior (World Bank 2024, 2025). First, it offers 
a comprehensive review of international commod-
ity arrangements since the early 20th century for 
both non-oil and oil commodities. Second, it 
distinguishes between two earlier approaches to 
supply management: (i) coordinated action by 
producers and consumers within a unified institu-
tional framework, as in most post-World War II 
(WWII) non-oil ICAs; and (ii) producer-led 
supply management, as in the oil market by the 
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Coun-
tries (OPEC), which has been countered by efforts 
to coordinate consumer responses, such as 
through the International Energy Agency (IEA). 
Third, it draws policy lessons from these arrange-
ments, providing insights relevant, for example, to 
current debates on food and energy security, and 
the availability and use of critical minerals.

 OPEC endures, it continues to face pressures from 
new oil sources, shifting consumer strategies, and 
international coordination of consumer responses 
(particularly through the IEA), to enhance energy 
security and diversification. These experiences 
caution against the adoption of recent cartel and 
inventory proposals. Instead, durable protection 
for producers and consumers could be achieved 
through continued reliance on market-based 
pricing; greater diversification of production and 
consumption; increased efficiency, including 
through technological innovation; and improved 
data transparency. 
Non-oil commodity  
agreements  
Pre-WWII agreements 
More than 20 non-oil agreements and cartels were 
established before WWII (table SF.1). Most in-
volved industrial commodities (metals, agricultural 
raw materials), although some involved beverages 
(coffee, tea) and foods (beef, sugar, wheat). 
Metals  
There was extensive intervention in the aluminum 
market in the early 20th century, as major produc-
ers formed cartels to control prices and output. 
These cartels collapsed under pressures from com-
petitive forces, economic downturns, and wars 
(Bertilorenzi 2013). Although formal cartels ended 
at the start of WWII, coordination among pro-
ducers persisted until 1978 when the introduction 
of aluminum futures trading on the London Metal 
Exchange marked a shift toward a more transpar-
ent and competitive market. 
The first cartel targeting copper, established in 
1918, used export quotas to liquidate World War 
I (WWI) surpluses but disbanded in 1924 
(Walters 1944). A second cartel, formed in 1926 
by U.S. and European producers, collapsed in 
1932 during the Great Depression. Tin was man-
aged by the 1921 Bandoeng Pool, which disposed 
of postwar surpluses before dissolving in 1924. In 
the 1930s, the Netherlands and the U.K. tried to 
stabilize tin prices through quotas and buffer 
stocks, but these efforts failed (Baranyai 1959).

FIGURE SF.1 Real commodity prices and periods of 
agreements, 1950-2024 
While trends and fluctuations in the prices of commodities subject to 
agreements have been highly heterogeneous, most prices reached secular 
highs in real terms during the boom of the 1970s. Since the collapse of the 
natural rubber agreement in 1999, no new commodity agreements have 
been established.

Three key conclusions are drawn from the histori-
cal experience with ICAs. First, some pre-WWII 
efforts related to non-oil commodities (for exam-
ple, in the markets for aluminum, copper, tin, and 
wool), particularly those marked by limited scope 
and membership, achieved price stabilization. 
Second, most pre- and post-WWII non-oil ar-
rangements eventually collapsed (figure SF.1.A-F), 
while oil market interventions either ended ab-
ruptly or waned (tables SF.1-3). Third, while

London Silver Agreement, promoted by the U.S. 
to support domestic producers after the 1929 
crash. It aimed to boost global prices through 
supply restrictions and government purchases but 
failed to do so and was not renewed after 1937 
(Davis 1946). 
Agricultural raw materials  
The market for wool, vital for military uniforms, 
was managed by intergovernmental schemes in 
both World Wars (Briggs 1947). During WWI, 
Britain secured all exportable wool from Australia, 
New Zealand, and South Africa under the Imperi-
al Wool and Sheepskin Contract. After prices 
collapsed in 1921, a U.K.-Australia plan succeeded 
in stabilizing the market by 1924. A similar 
scheme was used during WWII, followed by 
surplus disposal. These are regarded as successful 
cases of international cooperation, though wool’s 
importance subsequently declined with the rise of 
cotton and synthetic fibers. 
The natural rubber market was regulated be-
tween 1922 and 1928 under Britain’s Stevenson 
Plan, which imposed export quotas on its colonies 
of Malaya and Ceylon. However, the resulting 
higher prices encouraged production elsewhere, 
eroding Britain’s market share. After the 1929 
crash, the 1934 International Rubber Regulation 
Agreement (revised in 1938) sought price stability, 
but price swings persisted, and the scheme ended 
with WWII (Roberts 1951). 
Lumber demand collapsed in the Depression and 
prices were depressed further by Soviet exports. 
The League of Nations’ 1932 wood conference led 
to the 1935 European Timber Exporters Conven-
tion, where nine countries set quotas that stabi-
lized markets until WWII. 
Beverages  
Brazil, producing over 85 percent of the world’s 
coffee, launched a series of programs in 1905 to 
restrict supply through planting bans and purchas-
es by banks for stock accumulation (Hutchinson 
1909). These efforts were initially profitable for 
the banks, but the increased prices spurred pro-
duction outside regulated areas, and the programs 
were abandoned. After the 1929 stock market 
crash, a coffee control scheme was undertaken by 
Brazil (1930-37); the scheme failed despite costly 
stock destruction, and Brazil’s share of global 
production fell to 55 percent by 1940 (Wickizer 
1943). The Inter-American Coffee Agreement 
(1941-45) raised global coffee prices but also 
brought new producers into the market. 
For tea, a steep post-WWI price drop led produc-
ers in India, Ceylon, and the Dutch Indies to 
restrict supplies during 1929-33, helping price 
recovery (Roberts 1951). In 1933, a new price-
support scheme was introduced, with export 
quotas and planting restrictions. Backed by the 
U.K. and the Netherlands, the scheme was en-
forced effectively through the London Tea Auc-
tion, but production grew in non-participating 
countries such as China and Japan. The system 
ended in 1947, as rising postwar demand boosted 
prices. 
Food commodities  
Cuba introduced sugar supply controls in 1928, 
but these were quickly undermined by rising U.S. 
and Japanese output. The 1931 Sugar Agreement, 
which involved export and production quotas 
agreed by seven exporting countries, helped to 
reduce stocks during the Great Depression but 
collapsed in 1935 due to increased output by non-
participating countries (Hagelberg and Hannah 
1994). A broader 1937 pact among 21 nations 
involved export quotas and production limits but 
was disrupted by WWII and ended in 1946. 
Wheat was the only annual crop for which there 
was a major agreement. The 1933 pact, among 
nine exporters and twelve importers, imposed 
export and import quotas and acreage limits but 
collapsed within a year due to weak monitoring 
and a bumper harvest (Tyszynski 1949). Britain, 
the world’s largest beef importer at the time, led 
the 1937 International Beef Agreement, initially 
allocating its market to Australia, Ireland, and 
New Zealand, which were later joined by Argenti-
na, Brazil, and Uruguay. It stabilized prices for 
three years at low levels (Tsou and Black 1944), 
before being suspended early in WWII. Postwar 
attempts to revive it failed.

Post-WWII agreements 
Numerous commodity agreements were negotiat-
ed around the end of WWII, within the frame-
works of the United Nations Conference on Food 
and Agriculture (1943) and the Havana Charter 
(1948) (Baranyai 1959). These agreements cov-
ered tin and four agricultural commodities—
cocoa, coffee, sugar, and wheat (Gilbert 1987; 
Swerling 1968). A renewed UN-led effort in the 
mid-1970s added natural rubber (Gilbert 1996). 
Unlike pre-WWII agreements—formed mostly 
only by producers—the post-WWII agreements 
involved both exporters and importers, seeking 
“fair” prices through export and import quotas 
and inventory management (table SF.2). The 
shares of member countries in global production 
in post-WWII agreements varied around an aver-
age of about 65 percent, except that in the case of 
wheat the share was about 20 percent (figure 
SF.2.A). All the agreements collapsed—coffee, 
sugar, and tin in the 1980s; cocoa in 1993; and 
natural rubber in 1999. A comparison of price 
volatility between periods with and without agree-
ment shows mixed results: volatility was lower in 
agreement periods for tin and wheat, higher for 
sugar, and broadly similar for the other four com-
modities (figure SF.2.B). 
Coffee 
The International Coffee Agreement (1962) intro-
duced export quotas agreed by 42 producers and 
seven major consumers (Akiyama and Varangis 
1990). It was supported by the United States, with 
the objective of stabilizing Central American 
countries economically and politically, and by 
European countries that sought to aid former 
colonies (Bates 1997). Undermined by Viet Nam’s 
rise as a major exporter, the agreement collapsed 
in 1989, with prices allowed to fall (Baffes, Lewin, 
and Varangis 2005). 
Cocoa 
The 1972 International Cocoa Agreement fol-
lowed a 1964 agreement that had survived for 
only a year. The 1972 agreement, which was 
extended four times, used buffer stocks and export 
controls but struggled financially, as the largest 
producer (Côte d’Ivoire) and consumer (the U.S.) 
were not members. It exhausted funds quickly, 
faced compliance issues, and was abandoned in 
1993 after failing to keep prices within target 
ranges (Gilbert 1996). 
Natural rubber  
The 1979 Agreement—part of the Integrated 
Program for Commodities designed to improve 
prospects for commodity exporters and adopted in 
1976 by UNCTAD—stabilized prices through 
buffer stocks and an index tied to the currencies of 
key members (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand; 
Khan 1980). It faltered during the Asian financial 
crisis, as steep local-currency depreciations in-
creased domestic prices of natural rubber and 
triggered stock releases despite weak demand. The 
agreement collapsed in 1999 after major producers 
withdrew and inventories were released, flooding 
the market. 
Sugar 
The International Sugar Agreement (1953, re-
newed in 1958, 1968, and 1977) used quotas, 
price ranges, import limits, and stockholding, but 
had only limited success in stabilizing prices. By 
1978, the European Community, a nonmember,

four other commodities.

had become the largest net exporter, shaping 
world trade through its internal regime (Hagelberg 
and Hannah 1994). The agreement ended in 1984 
as new producers gained market share. 
Tin 
Te International Tin Agreement (1954) sought 
to raise and stabilize prices through export quotas 
and inventory management. It initially succeeded, 
but higher prices led to new producers (notably 
Brazil) and substitution with other metals (like 
aluminum). By 1985, it was unable to ﬁnance its 
buﬀer stocks and collapsed, leading to price de-
clines and mine closures (Nappi 1990). 
Wheat 
The International Wheat Agreement (1949) creat-
ed a multilateral contracting system under which 
producers (consumers) would commit to maxi-
mum (minimum) prices (Goley 1950). Its opera-
tions were maintained for more than two decades 
by intergovernmental trade, and it was renewed 
several times, but it eventually failed to stabilize 
prices and collapsed in 1971, in the early stages of 
the commodity price boom. 
Though ineffective at stabilizing prices beyond the 
short term, many ICAs (e.g., the International 
Cocoa Organization, the International Coffee 
Organization, and the International Sugar Organi-
zation) evolved and engaged in market monitor-
ing, gathering and providing intelligence, and 
technical assistance. These bodies preserved insti-
tutional knowledge, offered neutral producer—
consumer platforms, and remain sources of exper-
tise within the broader network of International 
Commodity Bodies and International Study 
Groups. 
Oil agreements 
Pre-1973 oil arrangements 
After oil was discovered in Pennsylvania in 1859, 
prices became highly volatile, swinging through 
boom-and-bust cycles with destabilizing conse-
quences for producers and consumers. Early pro-
ducer groups, starting with the Oil Creek Associa-
tion in 1861, attempted to restrict output and 
raise prices but proved unsuccessful (table SF.3). 
Price volatility subsided once Rockefeller’s Stand-
ard Oil Trust consolidated the industry, bringing 
greater stability between the 1870s and the 1910s 
(McNally 2017). However, following the breakup 
of the Trust under U.S. antitrust law in 1912, 
price volatility re-emerged. In the 1930s, control 
of pricing shifted to seven multinational, vertically 
integrated oil companies, in which global produc-
tion was highly concentrated (Adelman 1972).2 
In addition, the Texas Railroad Commission 
(TRC) introduced prorationing in the 1930s to 
manage surplus capacity, while federal oil import 
controls began in 1959 under the Mandatory Oil 
Import Program (Blair 1978).3 Between 1960 and 
1972, the volatility of oil prices was among the 
lowest of traded industrial commodities, support-
ing rapid postwar demand growth of nearly 8 
percent annually. By the early 1970s, however, the 
global dominance of the major oil companies 
waned, and U.S. surplus capacity dissipated, pav-
ing the way for OPEC’s rising influence. 
OPEC was founded in 1960 with the objective to 
“coordinate and unify petroleum policies among 
member countries, in order to secure fair and 
stable prices for petroleum producers” (OPEC 
2020).4 The República Bolivariana de Venezuela, 
the group’s largest producer in its early years, 
accounting for more than one third of the group’s 
combined output, proposed that the organization 
be modelled after the TRC by withholding supply 
to achieve higher prices (figure SF.3.A). Other 
members, however, favored negotiating higher 
posted prices with the multinational companies 
2 The multinational companies, often called the “Seven Sisters,” 
were British Petroleum (BP), Chevron, Exxon, Gulf, Mobil, Shell, 
and Texaco (Sampson 1975).  
3 Prorationing was the limiting of oil output from pools or wells 
to balance supply and demand and was implicitly designed to 
stabilize prices. It was mainly used in Oklahoma, Texas, and some 
other oil producing states (McNally 2017).  
4 OPEC—which as of 2025 comprises 12 member countries—
was established at the Baghdad Conference of September 10-14, 
1960, by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and República Bolivariana 
de Venezuela. Others joined the organization later, including Qatar 
(1961; withdrew in 2019), Indonesia (1962; withdrew in 2009, 
rejoined in 2015, and withdrew again in 2016), Libya (1962), the 
United Arab Emirates (1967), Algeria (1969), Nigeria (1971), 
Ecuador (1973; withdrew in 1992, rejoined in 2007, and withdrew 
again in 2020), Gabon (1975; withdrew in 1995, rejoined in 2016), 
Angola (2007; withdrew in 2024), Equatorial Guinea (2017), and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (2018).

 and prices more than doubled in 1979-80. OPEC 
raised official prices in this period but did little to 
increase supply. Meanwhile, consumption fell 
while 
non-OPEC output—particularly from 
Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, and the North Sea—
surged. By 1983, OPEC’s market share had 
dropped below 30 percent, leaving it with large 
surplus capacity. OPEC introduced production 
quotas in 1982, with Saudi Arabia—the group’s 
largest supplier—agreeing to act as swing producer 
(figure SF.3.B). With its production and market 
share having plummeted, Saudi Arabia abandoned 
this role in 1985, boosting production and send-
ing prices below $8/bbl by April 1986 (Adelman 
1995). OPEC subsequently abandoned official 
price-setting, focused on quotas, and let market 
forces determine prices. Between 1986 and 1999, 
oil prices averaged $18/bbl, with the effect of the 
large OPEC surplus capacity exacerbated by the 
collapse of Soviet oil demand in the 1990s (World 
Bank 2009). 
In the 2000s, surging demand by emerging market 
and developing economies (EMDEs), led by 
China, fueled what became known as a price 
“super cycle” (figure SF.4.A). Oil prices averaged 
$83/bbl in terms of 2010 dollars—deflated by the 
U.S. consumer price index—during 2000-24, 
more than double the $33/bbl of 1986-99, with 
far greater volatility of nominal prices (figure 
SF.4.B). Prices peaked above $130/bbl (nominal) 
in 2008, with spare capacity nearly exhausted 
(OPEC 2001-08). The global financial crisis of 
2008-09 then triggered a collapse in prices, but 
OPEC production cuts sparked a rebound, with 
prices staying above $100/bbl from 2011 to mid-
2014. Buoyed by high revenues, OPEC adopted 
an overall production target, with Saudi Arabia 
again acting as swing producer. 
In 2014, the continued rise of U.S. shale output 
(from 5 mb/d in 2008 to 13 mb/d in 2024) erod-
ed OPEC’s market share, and OPEC responded 
by expanding production, driving prices below 
$30/bbl by January 2016 (Baffes et al. 2015). This 
attempt to undercut shale producers proved inef-
fective, as the costs of shale production declined 
because of efficiency gains and technological 
innovation. In 2016, OPEC sought broader coop-
eration and established OPEC+ in partnership 
FIGURE SF.3 Oil production by OPEC members and 
partner countries  
When OPEC was founded in 1960, its members accounted for about 40 
percent of global oil production, with Venezuela the dominant producer. By 
the early 1970s, OPEC’s share had climbed to roughly 50 percent, with 
Saudi Arabia emerging as the largest producer and de facto leader—a 
position it has since retained. As OPEC’s market share later plateaued, the 
organization began working with non-member partner producers to 
facilitate potential supply cuts. These collaborations were formalized in 
1998 and again in 2016, the latter creating the OPEC+ alliance.

from which export revenues were derived. Despite 
rising output during the 1960s, OPEC’s market 
influence remained limited. 
OPEC since 1973 
By 1970, OPEC accounted for about half of 
global oil production and began using its collective 
power to demand higher prices from major oil 
companies. The 1973 Yom Kippur War led Arab 
Gulf members to cut output and impose an em-
bargo on the U.S. and its allies. OPEC quadrupled 
its official price in U.S. dollar terms within 
months, and many members nationalized oil 
assets, shifting major companies from producers to 
buyers of crude in a growing spot market. 
Member countries of the Organization for Eco-
nomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
responded by creating the IEA in 1974 to reduce 
dependence on imported oil, build emergency 
reserves, and coordinate supply during crises. 
The Iranian Revolution (1979) and Iran-Iraq War 
(1980-88) triggered further supply disruptions,

with 10 nonmember producers, which jointly 
agreed to cut production by 1.8 mb/d. Prices 
stabilized near $60/bbl during 2017-19 but re-
mained well below earlier peaks as U.S. shale 
production continued to grow. History, in some 
ways, repeated itself: just as the high prices of the 
1970s spurred production from new oil sources in 
Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, and the North Sea, 
the 2000s boom encouraged the development of 
other sources, including Canadian bitumen and 
oil sands, biofuels, and U.S. shale production 
(figures SF.5.A and SF.5.B). 
During the 2020s, the oil market has faced un-
precedented shocks. The COVID-19 pandemic 
led to record price declines, prompting a tempo-
rary 9.7 mb/d cut in OPEC+ production in May 
2020. Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine briefly 
lifted prices to $120/bbl, but resilient Russian 
supply and weak demand led to production cuts 
of 4.6 mb/d by June 2023. Prices averaged below 
$80 in 2024, weighed down by non-OPEC sup-
ply. In April 2025, OPEC+ began reversing its 
cuts, helping to lower the Brent benchmark to  
$60-70/bbl in May-October. 
Responses to OPEC 
In the wake of the 1973 oil shock, member coun-
tries of the OECD worked to establish a coordi-
nated response among consumer countries. In 
November 1974, an agreement on an Internation-
al Energy Program was signed, leading to the 
creation of the IEA under the framework of the 
OECD. Te Agreement was bound by interna-
tional treaty to ensure the highest commitment 
from governments to the program, particularly 
concerning the rules governing the IEA’s Oil 
Emergency Sharing System (IEA 1994a). 
In its early years, the IEA focused on short-term 
strategies, such as establishing storage and con-
sumption frameworks to address potential supply 
disruptions. Later, it promoted longer-term 
measures to reduce dependence on oil imports, 
including improving the eﬃciency of oil con-
sumption, investing in domestic oil production, 
and promoting the development of substitutes 
such as coal, natural gas, nuclear power, and re-
newable energy sources (IEA 1994b). Te IEA’s 
objectives have since broadened to the promotion 
FIGURE SF.4 Real oil prices and volatility of nominal oil 
prices 
In the first oil price shock, in 1973, real oil prices quadrupled, and in the 
second shock in 1979, they more than doubled again. Since then, real 
prices have fluctuated around an average roughly eight times higher than 
their 1950-1972 average. Volatility also increased significantly: between 
1960 and 1972, oil prices were among the least volatile of internationally 
traded commodities, but since 1973, they have ranked among the most 
volatile.

FIGURE SF.5 Sources of global oil production  
The oil price spikes of the 1970s made higher-cost non-OPEC production 
economically viable, spurring major developments in the North Sea, 
Alaska, and Mexico. Similarly, the post-2000 price boom catalyzed the 
emergence of new and expanding supply sources—including U.S. shale 
crude and natural gas liquids (NGLs), Canadian oil sands, Brazil’s offshore 
fields, and biofuels. In both periods, the expansion of non-OPEC 
production reduced OPEC’s market share.

of aﬀordable and sustainable energy systems and 
to advancing the energy transition (IEA 2021, 
2023). Te IEA became a catalyst for numerous 
changes in the global oil industry, complemented 
by initiatives from both governments and the 
private sector, as described below. 
• 
Reduced oil dependence and diversified resource 
base. Oil’s share of total energy consumption 
fell from nearly 50 percent in the early 1970s 
to about 30 percent by 2020 (figure SF.6.A). 
The share of natural gas expanded through its 
growing use in electricity generation, space 
heating, and industry, while the share of 
nuclear power grew rapidly in certain coun-
tries, particularly France, although globally it 
has declined since around 2000. The share of 
renewables has risen from below 1 percent in 
2000 to almost 8 percent in 2022 (figure 
SF.6.B). The diversification of energy sources 
is shown by the Herfindahl index of market 
concentration, which dropped from 0.33 in 
the early 1970s to 0.24 in 2022 (figure 
SF.6.C). Oil intensity—the amount of oil 
needed to produce one unit of GDP—has 
halved since the early 1970s, mirroring de-
clines in overall energy intensity (figure 
SF.6.D). This trend is similar across OECD 
and non-OECD countries, but oil intensity 
remains higher and more variable in the latter. 
The decline in intensity reflects both greater 
productive efficiency—partly due to techno-
logical advances—and a shift in the composi-
tion of output toward less energy-intensive 
services. Despite the decline in energy intensi-
ty, global per capita oil consumption has 
remained remarkably stable, declining in 
OECD countries but rising in most others, as 
per capita income growth offset efficiency 
gains. 
• 
Strategic reserves. All IEA members except oil 
exporters Canada, Mexico, and Norway, are 
mandated to hold reserves equal to 90 days of 
net oil imports (figure SF.7.A). These are 
managed by governments or private entities. 
The U.S. established its Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve (SPR) in 1975, with capacity exceed-
ing 700 MMbbl—equivalent to about five 
weeks of current domestic consumption or 
one week of global consumption (figure 
SF.7.B). The SPR has been drawn on several 
times, including after the oil price surge fol-
lowing Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. 
Other OECD countries held an average of 
850 MMbbl in reserves in 2024. Non-IEA 
countries also maintain large reserves—more 
than 700 MMbbl in the case of China and  
55 MMbbl in the case of India (Zhang 2024). 
Numerous bilateral and regional energy coop-
FIGURE SF.6 Market shares of energy sources, 
consumption intensity, and market concentration  
Oil's share of global energy use fell from nearly 50 percent in the early 
1970s to about 30 percent by 2020, as natural gas, nuclear power, and 
renewables gained ground. The oil intensity of GDP has halved over the 
past 50 years, driven by efficiency gains, including through technological 
improvements (especially in transport), and shifts in output toward less 
energy-intensive services. This trend holds for both OECD and non-OECD 
countries, though levels remain higher in the latter. Despite falling oil 
intensity, per capita oil use has remained broadly stable—declining in 
OECD countries but rising elsewhere. The energy mix has become more 
diverse, as reflected by a decline in the Herfindahl index from 33 to 24 
percent.

eration arrangements have been established to 
further bolster supply security. 
• 
Coordinated policy responses. In the event of 
signiﬁcant actual or potential supply disrup-
tion, the IEA can coordinate responses among 
members, such as the release of emergency oil 
inventories and the implementation of de-
mand-restraint measures, ranging from volun-
tary conservation to fuel rationing. It may also 
promote fuel switching, increased oil produc-
tion, and the temporary easing of regulatory 
measures, including fuel specifications and 
quality standards. Since its inception, the IEA 
has undertaken collective action on five occa-
sions: ahead of the Gulf War in 1991; after 
damage to offshore oil infrastructure caused 
by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005; in 
response to the prolonged supply disruption 
from the Libyan Civil War in 2011; and twice 
during the Ukraine war (March and April 
2022). 
• 
Knowledge generation and information sharing. 
Before the 1973 oil shock, public information 
about energy markets was limited, due to the 
industry’s highly concentrated structure of 
vertically integrated producing companies. 
Following the shock, such information ex-
panded significantly. Today, a wide array of 
reports, analyses, and datasets are produced by 
international organizations (including the IEA 
and OPEC), governments (including the U.S. 
Energy Information Administration), ex-
changes, financial companies, consultancies, 
and industry specialists. The International 
Energy Forum (IEF) is another intergovern-
mental body, which promotes data sharing 
and dialogue among more than 70 energy-
producing and consuming nations. A major 
IEF initiative is the Joint Organizations Data 
Initiative (JODI), which compiles and pub-
lishes monthly indicators on global energy 
supply and demand, although submissions 
have become limited. 
• 
Price benchmarking. Before WWII, there were 
no global price benchmarks for oil, as vertical-
ly integrated firms transferred oil internally 
(Adelman 2002). After the war, a single Per-
sian Gulf f.o.b. price emerged as the main 
reference, and subsequently other benchmarks 
emerged for specific crudes, such as Saudi 
Light 34° API, a key OPEC reference. As spot 
quotations proliferated, price discounting and 
underreporting by OPEC members were 
exposed, prompting the group to abandon 
official pricing in the mid-1980s. Greater 
transparency and spot trading paved the way 
for futures contracts—first for heating oil 
(1978), then West Texas Intermediate (1983), 
and Brent (1988). These highly liquid con-
tracts support hedging and price discovery, 
especially during shocks such as the 2008 
financial crisis (figure SF.8.A), the post-crisis 
recovery (ﬁgure SF.8.B), the 2014 price col-
lapse (ﬁgure SF.8.C), and the 2020 pandemic 
outbreak (ﬁgure SF.8.D). Futures curves—
whether in backwardation (i.e., falling prices 
with lengthening maturities) or contango (i.e., 
rising prices with lengthening maturities)—
reﬂect near-term fundamentals and longer-
term expectations, making the spread between 
short- and long-dated contracts a key gauge of 
market sentiment. 
FIGURE SF.7 Government-controlled inventories held by 
OECD member countries  
All IEA member countries are required to maintain oil reserves equivalent to 
at least 90 days of net imports. The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
peaked at 727 million barrels in 2010 but fell to 350 million barrels by 
September 2023, following multiple drawdowns—including those triggered 
by the oil price spike after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. European and 
Asian countries maintain comparable reserves of around 400 million barrels 
each. Europe’s stockpiles consist of both crude oil and refined products, 
while Asia’s reserves are composed mainly of crude oil.

Lessons and policy implications 
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
there have been sharp swings in commodity prices. 
Movements in the prices of industrial commodi-
ties were largely synchronized by global macroeco-
nomic forces, while the prices of agricultural 
commodities were more affected by localized 
supply shocks (World Bank 2025). In the post-
pandemic period, volatility has been historically 
high, with cycles occurring about every two 
years—half their previous duration—and booms 
becoming more intense. These shifts reflect a mix 
of adverse events, including the recession during 
the pandemic, natural disasters, geopolitical ten-
sions, and armed conflicts, as well as longer-term 
trends such as energy diversification and increasing 
international economic fragmentation. Synchro-
nized price rises across commodities reduce con-
sumers’ ability to substitute higher-priced with 
lower-priced products, which amplifies welfare 
losses and complicates counter-inflation policies 
(World Bank 2024). Against this backdrop, this 
special focus examined one type of market inter-
vention—international commodity agreements. 
Implemented across several commodity markets in 
the latter half of the 20th century, ICAs sought to 
stabilize prices, reduce the volatility of export and 
fiscal revenues in producing countries, and curb 
commodity price-driven inflation in importing 
economies. 
ICAs were undermined by a central contradiction: 
when they stabilized or raised prices to balance the 
interests of producers and consumers, they trig-
gered market forces that ultimately undermined 
their goals. Higher prices spurred innovation and 
production outside the agreements (as expected by 
the induced-innovation hypothesis; Hicks 1932). 
They also created incentives for quota violations 
and led consumers to seek substitutes or econo-
mize 
through 
improvements 
in 
efficiency 
(Johnson 1983). Such market responses led to 
failures of ICAs across various commodities, such 
as coffee, natural rubber, and tin. Efforts to main-
tain price bands through physical stockpiling 
underscored the financial and logistical challenges 
of countering market forces. This outcome aligns 
with theoretical models of competitive storage, 
which predict that prolonged departures of prices 
from market fundamentals will lead to excessive 
inventory accumulation or depletion (Williams 
and Wright 1991). The collapse of the Interna-
tional Tin Agreement in 1985—leaving substan-
tial debts and legal disputes—highlights the risks 
of large-scale intervention. These challenges were 
especially apparent in post-WWII agreements, 
which aimed to balance the needs of both produc-
ers and consumers, unlike most pre-WWII agree-
ments, which primarily served producer interests. 
Some pre-WWII agreements achieved their stated 
objectives: the Copper Export Association (1918-
24) liquidated excess inventories after WWI; the 
Bandoeng Pool reduced tin inventories (1921-25); 
and the Aluminum Alliance stabilized prices dur-
ing 1931-39 through inventory management. 
FIGURE SF.8 Futures curves for the WTI benchmark 
price 
Highly liquid futures contracts facilitate hedging and price discovery, 
including when shocks occur. For instance, the global financial crisis 
prompted a parallel downward shift in the futures curve, followed by a 
comparable recovery. Futures curves also capture transitions in market 
conditions—from tight supply, characterized by backwardation (prices 
falling with lengthening maturities), to more normal or oversupply 
conditions, characterized by contango (prices rising with lengthening 
maturities).

Two wool agreements (1916-20 and 1940-46) 
also stabilized prices and ensured garment supplies 
for Allied forces via government procurement. 
More recently, pragmatic approaches—such as the 
maintenance of strategic oil reserves by producers 
and consumers—have helped cushion short-term 
disruptions while not being intended to shape 
long-term price trends. 
OPEC’s longevity stands out among other ICAs. 
This partly reflects its willingness to adapt: shifting 
from fixed prices to market-based pricing; adopt-
ing flexible production quotas tied to nonrigid 
price targets; expanding cooperation through 
OPEC+, a broader alliance commanding a signifi-
cantly larger share of global oil production; and 
engaging in dialogue with consumer countries. 
Still, OPEC faces the same persistent challenges as 
other commodity agreements—in particular, new 
sources of supply and shifting demand preferences. 
These are now compounded by the structural 
transformation of global energy markets, which 
may force OPEC to manage quotas in an environ-
ment of stagnant or even declining oil demand. 
Internationally coordinated responses to commod-
ity market disruptions can still play a stabilizing 
role. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for exam-
ple, OPEC+ production cuts, alongside voluntary 
and involuntary reductions by other producers, 
helped stabilize oil prices in the face of a historic 
collapse in economic activity. On the consumer 
side, strategic inventories have helped cushion 
short-term supply reductions. Meanwhile, greater 
knowledge sharing and improved data transparen-
cy have supported more informed policymaking 
and contributed to greater market stability. 
Experience suggests that proposals for new com-
modity arrangements should be considered with 
caution. While temporary interventions during 
acute supply disruptions can be effective, longer-
term price management schemes have a poor track 
record. The evidence points instead to a more 
resilient approach: fostering diversification of 
production and consumption; investing in tech-
nology and innovation; encouraging data transpar-
ency; and relying on market-based pricing mecha-
nisms. These tools offer more durable protection 
against commodity price volatility than attempts 
to manage prices and markets directly. In the food 
sector, for example, strategic grain reserves can 
support crisis management and emergency prepar-
edness, but their role should be limited to short-
term stabilization during market disruptions—not 
long-term price control (World Bank, FAO, and 
WFP 2025).

TABLE SF.3 Oil agreements and cartels  
Nature of agreement 
Mechanism (membership) 
Oil Creek Association (1861): Introduced production cuts and minimum selling price, poor 
compliance resulted in its collapse. 
Production cuts and minimum pricing (oil producers, U.S.) 
Petroleum Producers Association of Pennsylvania (1870): Imposed production 
restrictions, including an embargo on new drilling. The Association was unable to enforce 
them, leading to the collapse of the agreement. 
Production restrictions and embargo on drilling (oil 
producers, U.S.) 
Southern Improvement Company (SIC, 1872): Refiners and railroads agreed not to 
compete with one another, but drillers refused to sell oil to SIC participants, leading to the 
collapse of the scheme. 
Monopoly power among transportation and refining 
companies (refineries and railroad companies, U.S.) 
National Refiners Association (1872-73): Refiners agreed to control production and 
transport of oil. After initial success, weak compliance and free riding by non-members led 
to its collapse. 
Monopoly power among refining companies (refineries, 
U.S.) 
Petroleum Producers’ Agency (1872-73): Sought to control oil supplies, but the scheme 
collapsed within weeks due to weak compliance. 
Stockholding and production restrictions (oil producers, 
U.S.) 
Standard Oil (1872-1910s): At its peak it owned or controlled 90 percent of U.S. refining 
capacity and a large amount of transport. The company was later broken into 24 smaller 
companies following antitrust legislation. 
Monopoly power through transport and refining (Standard 
Oil, refineries) 
Achnacarry Agreement (1928): Also known as the “As-Is Agreement.” Major oil producers 
agreed to reduce competition by keeping market shares constant, fixing prices, and limiting 
new production. 
Production caps and fixed market shares (major oil 
companies, Middle East) 
Interstate Oil Compact Commission/Texas Railroad Commission (1935-1970s): The 
IOCC, which covered 80 percent of U.S. production, set quotas to stabilize prices. The IOCC 
was rendered redundant by declining U.S. production. 
Production quotas (state-level regulation of oil producers, 
U.S.) 
Seven Sisters (1935-1970s): The seven largest oil companies (outside the USSR) colluded 
to limit production from the Gulf. Increased production elsewhere, the loss of U.S. surplus 
capacity, and deteriorating relationships with concession countries paved the way for 
OPEC’s rise in influence. 
Production restraint, price setting (Seven Sisters), and 
dominance of production and refining 
OPEC (1960- ): Formed by five countries to prevent declines in “posted prices” by the major 
oil companies. The group later expanded, adopting production quotas as its main control 
mechanism from 1982 onward. 
Initially price setting, subsequently replaced by production

ECO-AUDIT 
Environmental Benefits Statement 
The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental 
footprint. In support of this commitment, we leverage electronic publishing 
options and print-on-demand technology, which is located in regional hubs 
worldwide. Together, these initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and 
shipping distances decreased, resulting in reduced paper consumption, 
chemical use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste.  
We follow the recommended standards for paper use set by the Green Press 
Initiative. The majority of our books are printed on Forest Stewardship Council 
(FSC)-certified paper, with nearly all containing 50-100 percent recycled 
content. The recycled fiber in our book paper is either unbleached or bleached 
using totally chlorine-free (TCF), processed chlorine-free (PCF), or enhanced 
elemental chlorine-free (EECF) processes.

Commodity prices are expected to decline by about 7 percent overall 
this year, reflecting subdued global economic activity, elevated 
trade tensions and policy uncertainty, ample global supply of oil, and 
weather-related supply shocks. In 2026, commodity prices are forecast 
to fall by a further 7 percent, a fourth consecutive year of decline, 
as global growth remains sluggish and the oil market oversupplied. 
Energy price movements are envisaged to continue contributing to 
global disinflation in 2026. Metals and minerals prices are expected 
to remain stable in 2026, while agricultural prices are projected to 
edge down, primarily due to strong supply conditions. Precious metals 
prices are expected to rise another 5 percent, after a historically large, 
investment-driven rally of about 40 percent in 2025. 
Risks to the commodity price projections are tilted to the downside. 
Key downside risks include weaker-than-expected global growth, 
a longer-than-assumed period of economic policy uncertainty, 
and additional oversupply of oil. Upside risks include intensifying 
geopolitical tensions, the market impact of additional oil sanctions, 
supply reductions stemming from additional trade restrictions, 
unfavorable weather conditions, faster-than-expected rollout of 
new data centers. Commodity price volatility in recent years has 
revived interest in supply management via international commodity 
agreements. Historical experience, however, shows that the most 
effective policy is to promote diversification, innovation, transparency, 
and market-based pricing—measures that build lasting resilience to 
commodity price volatility.
The World Bank Group’s Commodity Markets Outlook is published 
twice a year, in April and October. The report provides detailed 
market analysis for major commodity groups, including energy, 
metals, agriculture, precious metals, and fertilizers. Price forecasts 
for 46 commodities are presented together with historical price 
data. Commodity price data updates are published separately at the 
beginning of each month.
