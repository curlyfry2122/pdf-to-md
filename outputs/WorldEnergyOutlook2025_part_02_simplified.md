It is important to note that energy prices and both electricity and total energy bills may still 
rise over time in nominal terms because of general price inflation, even though they remain 
stable or fall when expressed in real, inflation‑adjusted terms, as in this Outlook.

Spending on electricity increases in most markets, though this can help reduce other 
energy bills, leading to declines in advanced economies and smaller increases elsewhere

How much difference will AI make to the future of 
energy?  
1.5.1 Electricity demand outlook from data centres 
In recent years, technology companies worldwide have been investing heavily in new data 
centre capacity to train and deploy increasingly large and widely used AI models. In 2025, 
around USD 580 billion is estimated to be invested in data centres (IEA, 2025b). This is more 
than total global investment in oil supply, which is projected to be around USD 540 billion in 
2025. This point of comparison provides a telling marker of the changing nature of modern, 
highly digitalised economies.  
Driven by surging data centre expansion, electricity consumption by AI-optimised servers 
increases fivefold by 2030. This contributes to a doubling of total electricity consumption by 
data centres by 2030 (Figure 1.16). Despite this rapid growth, data centres account for less

than 10% of global electricity demand growth between 2024 and 2030. Other sources, 
including industry, EVs and air conditioners, account for more of the growth in electricity 
demand.

Even as electricity consumption from AI-optimised servers surges, data centres remain 
just one of the many sources of electricity demand growth in most economies 
*Space and water heating in buildings.

Data centres are geographically concentrated, with the United States, China and Europe 
accounting for 82% of global capacity. Over the next few years, over 85% of data centre 
capacity additions are set to take place in these three regions. In China and the European 
Union, data centres account for 6-10% of the growth in electricity demand to 2030. This is 
much lower than the comparable figure in the United States – the world’s largest market for 
data centres – where data centres account around half of the growth in electricity demand 
in this period. 
Aggregate values do not reveal the full picture. A geospatial analysis of the data centre 
project pipeline reveals that over half of data centres under construction or announced are 
being developed in or close to cities with a population of at least 1 million people, where 
grids already cater to large loads; that 55% of the data centres in the pipeline are larger than 
200 megawatts (MW) in capacity, and would each consume as much electricity each year as 
around 200 000 households when they fully come online; and that nearly two-thirds of these 
upcoming data centres are in regions that are existing data centre clusters (Figure 1.17).

Figure 1.17 ⊳ Characteristics of data centre capacity in the pipeline 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
The majority of data centres in the pipeline are larger than 200 MW, are in clusters  
in and around large cities, and are located in the United States, China and Europe   
Notes: GW = gigawatt; MW = megawatt. Data centre clusters here refer to collections of facilities grouped 
according to the DBSCAN clustering algorithm using a neighbourhood radius of 100 km. Large clusters have at 
least 500 MW of maximum designed capacity and small clusters have between 100 MW and 500 MW of 
maximum designed capacity. Large cities refer to locations within 100 km of the centroid of cities with a 
population of at least 1 million people.  
Source: IEA analysis based on data from (OMDIA, 2025) and (IDC, 2024).  
This rapid build out of data centres – especially in clusters and around urban areas – comes 
with challenges. Grid congestion and connection queues are increasing in many regions, and 
connection queues for new data centres are often already long. While queue times are one 
to three years in the United States on average, it can take up to seven years to get connected 
in northern Virginia. In the United Kingdom and parts of Europe, the average time in the 
queue has been reported to be as high as seven or ten years. In Dublin, a data centre hub, 
new data centre connection requests have been paused until 2028. In addition, supply chains 
for key components like transformers, cables, gas turbines and critical minerals are already 
under pressure. For example, the backlog for the delivery of transformers has been 
lengthening, impacting the rollout of infrastructure catering to data centre construction. IEA 
analysis estimates that because of these factors, around 20% of the projected data centre 
additions by 2030 could be at risk of delay. 
1.5.2 Electricity supply to meet data centre loads 
The rapid rollout of data centres also has implications for supply. Most data centres are 
connected to the grid, and the electricity mix they consume reflects the electricity mix of the 
region in which they are located. At the global level, renewables remain the leading source 
of additional electricity for data centres in the STEPS, contributing around 45% of the growth

through to 2035, nearly 400 TWh. In the CPS, renewables also provide the largest share of 
incremental supply, although at around 40% it is slightly lower than in the STEPS. 
Natural gas also plays a key role to meet electricity demand growth from data centres, 
particularly in certain markets such as the United States and the Middle East. Global natural 
gas-fired generation for data centres increases by 220 TWh to 2035 in the STEPS, and by 
285 TWh in the CPS. However, the surge in orders for new gas turbines over the past two 
years has strained supply chains, increasing both wait times and delivery costs.  
Nuclear power is experiencing renewed policy support in many markets, and the technology 
sector is showing increasing interest in powering data centres with nuclear. In recent months, 
technology companies and utilities have announced deals to extend the lifetime of existing 
nuclear plants, and the first power purchase agreement has been signed with a 
demonstration small modular reactor to power a data centre. In the STEPS, nuclear power 
provides 190 TWh of additional electricity for data centres by 2035. 
1.5.3 AI for energy 
The role of AI in the energy sector goes well beyond being a driver of energy demand. AI is 
also important to the energy sector because of its potential to enhance the efficiency, 
security and cost effectiveness of energy operations (IEA, 2025b). AI is already being 
deployed in the oil and gas industry, in electricity generation and supply, and in energy-
consuming sectors, but its potential goes well beyond its present uses. IEA analysis indicates 
that widespread uptake of AI-related solutions for the energy sector has the potential to 
boost efficiency by 3-10% across the transport and industry sectors globally by 2035 
(Figure 1.18). This equates to total energy savings of 13.5 EJ, which is slightly larger than the 
total energy demand of Indonesia today. Widespread adoption of AI-led optimisation could 
facilitate the achievement of energy efficiency targets and unlock emissions reductions 
across key sectors.  
None of this is a given. Limited access to high-quality data sets, insufficient digital 
infrastructure, regulatory concerns around privacy and the need to manage cybersecurity 
risks are all barriers to making full use of AI. There is also a risk of rebound effects, for 
example if increasingly automated private transport contributes to a modal shift away from 
public transport.   
AI also offers potential to accelerate innovation in energy technologies. Many innovation 
challenges are characterised by the kinds of problems that AI is good at solving: multicriteria 
searches through extremely large and complex data sets to find optimal designs for 
materials, chemistries or catalysts, for example. However, the value of such searches 
depends critically on the data that is searched being sufficiently extensive, robust and 
information-rich to generate useful predictions. Once an AI model proposes candidates for 
further analysis, they need to be lab tested, integrated into working prototypes, and 
demonstrated at commercial scale. To make a real-world impact, products then need to be 
scaled into industrial supply chains and deployed. All of this takes time. Furthermore, some 
technologies may still involve a cost or efficiency penalty that hinders their adoption even 
after extensive AI-driven improvements. AI is therefore a useful tool, not a magic wand.

Widespread adoption of known AI applications has the potential to save 13.5 EJ in 2035, 
which is larger than the total energy consumption in Indonesia today 
Notes: EJ = exajoule. Materials research related to batteries considers historical global research and 
development for screening potential candidates. Conventional methods include both physical experiments 
and detailed mechanistic computer simulations.   
1.5.4 Known unknowns: a longer term view of AI implications on the 
outlook  
While the World Energy Outlook takes a relatively long-term look at energy trajectories, its 
analysis on AI focuses on the near term. AI is a disruptive technology with huge promise, 
uncertainty and hype. Its broader economic and social impacts are not yet fully visible. There 
are in addition several “known unknowns” that could affect the course of its development 
and its implications for the energy outlook. These include:  
 
GDP growth and rebound effects: The impact of AI on productivity and GDP growth is 
highly uncertain. Quantitative estimates range from modest to transformative. Higher 
GDP growth could lead to higher energy demand. There are potential GDP downsides as 
well, if the huge investment and valuation underpinning the current AI boom turn out 
to be misplaced in the near term. 
 
Efficiency trends in hardware and software: Huge progress is being made to improve 
the efficiency of AI-optimised chips, and breakthroughs in computing paradigms are 
possible. There is similar potential for improvements in the efficiency of AI models. 
Recent analysis from Google highlights these trends, reporting a 33-fold reduction in the 
per-prompt energy consumption of its Gemini model median prompt in just 12 months 
(Elsworth et al., 2025).

 
AI uptake: The scale of uptake of AI remains uncertain. The type of AI use also matters. 
Video and image generation are much more energy intensive than text generation. 
Agentic AI workloads, where AI models perform extended online tasks, are also highly 
energy intensive.   
 
Innovation in the energy system: Perhaps the most substantial mid-term impact of the 
use of AI in the energy sector could come from accelerated innovation in energy 
technologies. Sudden solutions to highly complex engineering and scientific challenges 
should not be banked on. Over time, however, incremental accelerations to energy 
innovation could have substantial, but uncertain, cumulative effects.   
As and when these impacts become apparent, their implications will need to be factored into 
the outlook. The IEA will continue to monitor the energy sector and broader AI impacts 
closely.  
1.6 
What more needs to be done to provide universal, 
affordable access to electricity and clean cooking?  
Achieving universal access to electricity and clean cooking is an integral part of strategies for 
economic and human development. Remarkable progress has been made over the past two 
decades: since 2000, 1.6 billion people have gained access to electricity, and 2.2 billion have 
moved away from traditional, inefficient cooking methods that harm both health and the 
environment. Yet the challenge remains vast. Today, around 730 million people still live 
without electricity, and nearly 2 billion – one-quarter of the global population – continue to 
rely on polluting cooking methods. 
Developing countries in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean have led progress over the 
past decades. Both regions have now achieved electrification rates of 98% and have 
registered major gains in clean cooking. Since 2010, almost 1.5 billion people in these regions 
have gained access to modern stoves and fuels, halving the total number of people without 
clean cooking in just fifteen years. Countries such as India, Indonesia and China have shown 
how ambitious policies and large-scale programmes can transform access, but less progress 
has been made in other countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, electrification and clean cooking 
initiatives have not kept pace with rapid population growth: the region remains home to 80% 
of the world’s population that lack access to electricity, and the number of people lacking 
clean cooking solutions continues to rise. 
Global progress has slowed in recent years. The Covid-19 pandemic, together with the 
impacts of the global energy crisis, strained public budgets and made affordability an even 
bigger challenge. Countries with large remaining access gaps face particularly steep barriers, 
including high financing costs, heavy debt burdens and shrinking development budgets. In 
2022, for the first time in decades, the number of people without access to electricity 
increased worldwide. That trend has since reversed, but progress remains slower than before 
the pandemic across all regions. While declining costs for solar PV and batteries, innovative

business models, new policy initiatives and fresh investment momentum for both electricity 
and clean cooking access have brought encouraging signs, current trajectories fall short of 
the pace required to deliver universal access over the next decade and even by mid-century. 
Successful examples from around the world show that ambitious access programmes can 
close large gaps in a relatively short time. The priority now is to build on these best practices 
by accelerating and scaling proven, affordable solutions, policy frameworks and programmes 
while tackling the barriers that continue to hold back progress in the regions most in need. 
Building on the analysis in Chapter 6, this section explores current trends and what more 
needs to be done to achieve universal access to modern energy services. It introduces a new 
scenario, the Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario (ACCESS), which 
projects how access rates would increase if countries were able to replicate the best rates of 
progress witnessed in other countries. 
1.6.1 Clean cooking access 
The pace of progress to expand access has slowed in recent years. In 2019, almost 120 million 
people globally gained access to clean cooking, while in 2023, 100 million people did so 
(Figure 1.19). In Asia, the countries that drove improvements over the past decades are 
seeing progress slow as they approach universal access. Part of this deceleration is offset by 
faster progress in Pakistan, Cambodia and Myanmar, which each recorded all-time highs in 
households gaining access in 2023. In Latin America and the Caribbean, recent progress has 
been limited and largely concentrated in the Central American countries.

While the number of people without access to clean cooking has been increasing in sub-
Saharan Africa, the underlying conditions for extending access have been gradually 
improving. Private sector businesses and financiers are participating more actively to 
facilitate access, and innovative technologies and business models are providing new and 
more cost-effective ways to broaden access. Clean cooking has also attracted recent political 
attention, with mentions in recent G7 and G20 communiqués and the launch of the 
2024 Clean Cooking Declaration. 
In a rising number of countries, national strategies, targeted subsidies, tax and tariff reforms, 
and results-based financing are broadening access and lowering household costs. IEA 
tracking shows that more than half of the population without access live in countries that 
demonstrated progress on policies related to clean cooking in 2024. Most progress is 
concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, where seven-in-ten people without access live in 
countries that have recently introduced policies designed to increase access to clean cooking.  
Policy action is the main differentiator between the scenarios. In the STEPS, policy 
commitments are translated into accelerated progress, with the number of people without 
access decreasing to below 1.7 billion by 2030. The decrease is driven by continued progress 
in Asia and successful efforts to halt the rise in the number of people without access in sub-
Saharan Africa, which peaks in 2028. In the CPS, by contrast, constrained public budgets, 
higher borrowing costs and slower implementation limit the extent to which outcomes 
improve. The pace of access gains slows, particularly in rural and peri-urban areas, leaving 
around 200 million more people without access to clean cooking in 2030 than in the STEPS.

The ACCESS shows what is possible by replicating the fastest historical rates of progress 
observed in comparable contexts. In the ACCESS, an average of around 130 million people 
gain the ability to use modern fuels for cooking each year up to 2040, putting the world on 
course for universal access to clean cooking around 2040 (Figure 1.20). The bulk of the 
acceleration occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, where success depends on a concentrated scale-
up of national, multilateral and private finance. Average annual investment needs for clean 
cooking are around USD 4 billion to 2040, with funding shifting from developing Asia, 80% of 
investment today, to sub-Saharan Africa, two-thirds of investment between 2035 and 2040. 
The make-up of financing evolves, with debt finance up from 35% today to nearly 60%. While 
the private sector provides the majority of capital, this is anchored in the ACCESS by public 
and concessional capital, particularly in less mature markets and lower income communities. 
In the ACCESS, demand for modern cooking fuels increases 1.5-times from current level by 
2040 in emerging market and developing economies. While this is a substantial shift – 
roughly equivalent to current total energy use in France – it accounts for a relatively small 
share of global energy demand growth. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) underpins 63% of new 
access, increasing its use in cooking to around 3.4 mb/d by 2040; electric cooking provides 
access to 18% of the population and adds about 120 TWh; bioethanol supports access for 4% 
and use rises to roughly 6.5 billion litres; and the use of biogas and modern solid biomass 
also expands. In sub-Saharan Africa, the transition to modern cooking fuels has a particularly 
pronounced impact, reshaping regional energy consumption patterns. 
1.6.2 Electricity access 
Progress on electricity access has been remarkable in recent decades. Since 2000, the 
number of people without electricity has fallen by almost a billion, and 40 countries have 
reached near-universal access (Figure 1.21). After setbacks related to the Covid-19 pandemic 
and the global energy crisis, the global trend is once again downward, but the pace of 
progress remains well below that achieved before the pandemic. In 2024, the number of 
people without access fell by 11 million, which is less than the average 65 million annual 
reductions seen between 2010 and 2019. 
Developing countries in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, which have driven most 
of the gains over the past two decades, are nearing universal access. As their contribution to 
global progress diminishes, attention is increasingly shifting to Africa, where 80% of the 
population still without access lives. In sub-Saharan Africa, the pace of electrification has also 
slowed. High levels of debt in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and the global energy 
crisis, combined with cuts in international aid, continue to weigh heavily on progress. In 2024, 
27 countries made less progress on electrification than on average during the 2015–2019 
period. 
New electrification policies and investment plans contribute to an improving outlook. Based 
on the IEA detailed tracking of energy access policies, around 60% of people without access 
live in countries that introduced new electricity access measures in 2024 and early 2025.

These include tax and consumer incentives, electrification programmes, national strategies 
and other targeted actions. Such domestic initiatives are being reinforced by international 
efforts, including those made under South Africa’s G20 Presidency and Mission 300, and may 
be further strengthened by the focus on electricity and clean cooking access at the 
COP30 meeting that will take place in Brazil in November 2025.

residential electricity consumption per capita with access, 
2000-2024 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Developing Asia is approaching universal electricity access and electricity use is rising, 
while progress in sub-Saharan Africa is stagnating and household consumption is falling 
Note: 2025e = estimated values for 2025. 
On the basis of current trends, around 710 million people are projected to remain without 
access to electricity in 2030, and 650 million in 2050. Recent policy momentum improves the 
outlook somewhat: in the STEPS, the number of people without electricity falls by an 
additional 70 million in 2030 and 140 million in 2050 compared with the CPS. However, the 
progress made in the STEPS remains insufficient to achieve universal access by 2030 or even 
by mid-century. 
By replicating the fastest electrification progress achieved, universal access to electricity 
could be reached within just a decade. The ACCESS sees an average of 80 million people gain 
access to electricity each year to 2035, with rapid parallel deployment of grids, mini-grids 
and stand-alone systems (Figure 1.22). By 2040, the additional electricity demand from 
households gaining access in the ACCESS scenario reaches 270 TWh – roughly equivalent to 
electricity consumption in Italy today. The impact is particularly pronounced in sub-Saharan 
Africa, where new access accounts for around 45% of additional electricity demand to 2040, 
compared with 15% in developing Asia and 6% in other regions.

The ACCESS outlook depends on around USD 250 billion of investment by 2035 to fund 
capital expenditure, including the cost of installing grid or mini-grid lines and equipment 
costs for decentralised solutions. This translates to around USD 23 billion of spending per 
year, which represents a sizeable portion of expected power sector investment outlays in the 
coming years, and would mean a sevenfold increase in the level of financing commitments 
directed to electricity access today. Mobilising more private finance is essential to expand 
electricity access at this pace, with several new financing solutions showing promise: these 
include off-balance sheet financing for stand-alone systems, and the use of local currency 
guarantees and green bonds for mini-grids. For smaller scale projects and harder-to-reach 
communities, private finance will rely on concessional and public finance to de-risk projects 
and ensure power is affordable for consumers.

How are critical minerals and other emerging issues 
changing the energy security landscape?  
In recent years, the global geopolitical landscape has been marked by more fragility and rising 
tensions. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and instability in the Middle East, concerns 
about the security and affordability of energy supply have deepened, prompting countries 
to prioritise security considerations in policy and investment decisions. Many countries are 
turning to more diversified or home-grown energy sources to reduce exposure to geopolitical

risk. At the same time, energy and material exports are increasingly being used as 
instruments of foreign policy. Alongside the expansion of global trade, there has been a 
notable rise in the use of trade measures as geopolitical tools, including restrictions on 
materials and access to technologies.  
Traditionally, energy security focused on ensuring the adequacy of supply, but diversity, 
flexibility and resilience are emerging as the new watchwords in today’s fragile environment. 
The focus of electricity policy is shifting from securing investment in generation capacity to 
mobilising investment in system flexibility that can balance increasingly volatile demand and 
supply. Rising risks of disruption from geopolitical tensions and extreme weather have 
pushed the resilience and diversity of supply sources higher up the policy agenda. At the 
same time, the scope of energy security has broadened as new risk factors come into play.  
1.7.1 Critical minerals and energy technology supply chains 
The coming Age of Electricity is creating new dependencies that broaden the scope and 
complexity of the energy security landscape. Critical minerals, which underpin a wide range 
of energy and industrial technologies, are a prime example of these new hazards. These 
minerals are vital for power grids, batteries and EVs, but they also play a crucial role in AI 
chips, jet engines, defence systems and other strategic industries. This makes them central 
not only to energy security but also to broader economic resilience. These minerals are not 
directly used to run cars or heat homes, so supply shortages do not have the same immediate 
impacts as those for fuels like oil and natural gas. Yet disruptions to their supply can still 
cripple key manufacturing industries, with far-reaching consequences for economies and 
jobs. 
Diversification is central to energy security, yet the production, refining and processing of 
critical minerals is becoming increasingly concentrated in a few countries, heightening 
vulnerability to shocks and disruptions. Between 2020 and 2024, most of the growth in 
refined production of key energy minerals came from the leading suppliers. As a result, 
geographic concentration in refining increased for nearly all key energy minerals, and 
particularly for nickel and cobalt. The average market share of the top-three refining nations 
of key energy minerals rose from around 82% in 2020 to 86% in 2024. 
Our detailed analysis of announced projects suggests that progress towards more diversified 
refining supply chains is set to be slow. By 2035, the average share of the top-three refined 
material suppliers is projected to decline only slightly to 82%, effectively returning to the 
concentration levels seen in 2020. In the CPS, supply concentration is likely to remain higher 
than in the STEPS: it projects weaker demand, which translates into lower prices that favour 
incumbent producers sitting at the lower end of the cost curve. In the NZE Scenario, supply 
concentration challenges are compounded by volume risks as demand increases at a much 
faster pace. 
Supply concentration is similarly stark across energy technology supply chains. In solar PV, 
China holds over 80% of global manufacturing capacity at every stage of the supply chain. In

wind power, it accounts for nearly 80% of nacelle production and over 70% of blade 
manufacturing. China’s dominance is even stronger in batteries, where it commands at least 
85% of capacity across the value chain and over 95% in the case of anodes. 
This high market concentration creates a risk of major supply shortfalls if production from 
the largest supplier is disrupted by extreme weather, technical failures or trade restrictions. 
For battery metals and rare earths, when the supply and demand of the largest producer are 
excluded, supplies outside the leading producer meet on average only half of the remaining 
demand in 2035. 
Expanding the scope of analysis to a wider set of 20 energy-related strategic minerals reveals 
further vulnerabilities, stemming from high supply concentration, price volatility and 
by-product dependence (IEA, 2025c). A key point from this analysis is that China is the 
dominant refiner for 19 of the 20 minerals analysed, holding an average market share of 
around 70% (Figure 1.23).

strategic minerals analysed, with an average market share of around 70%

Source: IEA (2025c). 
With a recent proliferation of export controls on key materials and technologies, these 
supply risks are no longer just a theoretical concern. As of October 2025, more than half of 
these 20 strategic minerals are subject to some form of export controls. A notable 
development came in April 2025, when the Chinese government introduced export controls 
on seven heavy rare earth elements, along with their related compounds, metals and

magnets. As export volumes fell sharply, many automotive manufacturers in the United 
States, Europe, and elsewhere struggled to secure rare earth magnets, and some were forced 
to cut utilisation rates or even temporarily shut down factories. In October 2025, these 
export controls were tightened to include parts, components and assemblies produced using 
Chinese materials or technologies. While the market sizes for these strategic minerals are 
relatively small compared with bulk materials, disruptions in their supply can nevertheless 
have outsized economic impacts. For example, a 10% disruption in rare earth magnet exports 
could affect the production of 6.2 million conventional cars, or almost 1 million industrial 
motors, or 230 000 civilian aircraft, or the construction of over 650 hyper-scale AI data 
centres. Determined action is required in the near term to enhance preparedness against 
potential disruptions, and over the longer term to diversify supply chains. 
1.7.2 Electricity security 
As the share of electricity in the global energy mix rises across all IEA scenarios, the need to 
ensure the resilience and security of power systems is moving to the top of the energy policy 
agenda. Its growing importance as a major energy carrier means that the economic cost of 
power outages and system failures is rising sharply. Recent blackouts in Chile and the Iberian 
Peninsula illustrate how quickly supply interruptions can cascade through increasingly 
interconnected systems, affecting millions of households and businesses (see Chapter 8). 
Ensuring electricity security begins with maintaining adequate supply to meet rising and 
increasingly variable demand. Electrification, climate change and shifting consumption 
patterns are reshaping electricity demand profiles. In the STEPS, global peak electricity 
demand increases by about 40% between 2024 and 2035. The CPS sees similar growth in 
peak demand, with lower levels of electrification counterbalanced by slower efficiency 
improvements. In the NZE Scenario, peak demand increases even faster as electrification 
accelerates across sectors, particularly in industry and transport. However, improvements in 
cooling efficiency and the widespread adoption of heat pumps for space heating reduces the 
temperature sensitivity of electricity demand, enhancing its resilience to weather extremes.  
On the supply side, the rapid deployment of variable renewables introduces new operational 
challenges. Systems dominated by renewables must be able to meet demand when low wind 
and solar output coincides with periods of high demand. Periods of high renewables 
generation can also pose stability challenges as low system inertia increases the risk of 
frequency deviations.  
Flexibility, defined as the ability to balance the variability of demand and supply, has become 
a critical element of electricity security. Short-term flexibility requirements, currently around 
10% of average demand in many systems, rise two- to seven-times by 2035 in the STEPS, 
outpacing electricity demand growth. The NZE Scenario projects a significantly higher need 
for short-term flexibility requirements, which rise two- to ten-times by 2035 to ensure 
system reliability amid the swift expansion of variable renewables and changing patterns of 
electricity demand (Figure 1.24). While dispatchable plants such natural gas, coal,

hydropower or nuclear plants remain essential, their role increasingly shifts from bulk 
generation towards ensuring secure capacity and flexibility. Batteries and demand response 
are set to become major contributors to system reliability, supplying most of the needed 
short-term flexibility by 2035. In 2024, global battery storage additions reached 77 GW 
thanks to strong policy support and declining technology costs. Total installed battery 
capacity reaches nearly 1 700 GW by 2035 in the STEPS, around 1 400 GW in the CPS, and 
close to 2 900 GW in the NZE Scenario.

scenario, 2024-2035

Both short-term flexibility needs and peak demand rise through to 2035;  
higher efficiency makes demand more resilient to extreme weather in the NZE Scenario

Economies = advanced economies; EMDE excl. China = emerging market and developing economies excluding

There are other important facets of electricity security as well. In many regions, seasonal 
flexibility needs grow faster than overall electricity demand by 2035 in the STEPS, and even 
more in the NZE Scenario, as a result of the increasing requirement to manage prolonged 
periods of low renewables output or temperature-driven demand changes. Ageing 
transmission and distribution networks pose increasing reliability risks, calling for targeted 
modernisation and digitalisation. Traditional market designs focused on ensuring sufficient 
generation capacity need to value flexibility, ancillary services and resilience, and market 
frameworks need to include incentives that reward demand response, smart infrastructure, 
and innovative technologies that facilitate efficient and secure management of controllable 
loads.

1.7.3 Infrastructure resilience 
The resilience of energy infrastructure in the face of natural hazards is becoming increasingly 
important. These hazards include geophysical risks such as earthquakes and tsunamis as well 
as extreme weather and related events such as storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves and 
wildfires. Extreme weather events are becoming more consequential, undermining the 
reliability of energy systems through outages and increasing delivery costs to consumers 
through losses, damages and higher insurance premiums. A new IEA dataset shows that 
extreme weather events caused nearly 300 disruptions of critical energy infrastructure in 
2023. Power lines proved most vulnerable, with damages to transmission and distribution 
grids accounting for about 85% of these incidents (Figure 1.25). Other notable impacts 
include: drought-related water scarcity that constrain hydropower output; wildfires that 
force utilities to de-energise power lines; and hailstorms that damage solar PV facilities. 
Rising electrification and digitalisation of economic activity means that power outages carry 
much more significant economic costs. 
Figure 1.25 ⊳ Impacts of extreme weather events in 2023, and additional 
power capacity needed from extreme heat in the STEPS, 2035 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
 Extreme weather caused power outages in more than 200 million households in 2023, 
additional capacity will be needed to compensate for extreme weather impacts  
Notes: GW = gigawatt; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario. The year 2023 provides a snapshot of the impacts of 
extreme weather events on energy infrastructure. It does not necessarily represent an average weather year, 
as weather is variable. Outage numbers are likely underestimated due to variability of reporting by region. 
Events are recorded as a single type, which consolidates compound effects such as storms leading to floods. 
“Extreme heat” is the difference between the median and the top-three peak demand values across 30 years 
of weather data (see Chapter 5, section 5.2.4). 
Recent trends show that some extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and 
intense. Extreme heat is a case in point. Rising temperatures drive electricity demand higher

as the use of air conditioners increases, and this particularly affects peak demand. In the 
STEPS, income-driven growth in the use of air conditioning raises peak demand by over 
330 GW by 2035 compared to today, and increasing use driven by long-term temperature 
rise adds another 170 GW. In very hot years, extreme peak temperatures could push demand 
up by an additional 260 GW. These cumulative increases would raise peak demand by over 
15% by 2035 over today’s level. The impacts are even more significant in the CPS, where less 
efficient air conditioning units and higher extreme temperatures amplify peak demand 
pressures. 
These pressures can be compounded by the effects of extreme weather on power 
infrastructure, for example when droughts reduce hydropower output or when there are 
long periods of low wind power output. High temperatures can also lower generation 
capacity at thermal plants due to constraints on the discharge of water used for cooling, 
equipment stress and physical decreases in production efficiency. When such capacity 
reductions coincide with surging demand from extreme heat, we estimate that the combined 
effect could add an additional 6% to projected peak demand by 2035 in both the CPS and the 
STEPS. This is equivalent to around one-half to one-third of typical reserve margins, 
highlighting the importance of considering extreme high temperatures during capacity 
adequacy planning. 
1.7.4 Oil and gas supply chains 
The importance of addressing emerging vulnerabilities does not imply any lessening of the 
need for vigilance when it comes to traditional oil and gas security. Concerns about tightness 
in fossil fuel markets are beginning to ease, but shifting geopolitical dynamics and persistent 
risks to oil and gas supply chains could quickly erode existing buffers and alter market 
balances. For example, accelerating decline rates in existing oil and gas fields pose major 
supply risks if adequate investment is not maintained. IEA analysis of around 15 000 fields 
worldwide shows that natural decline rates are becoming steeper (IEA, 2025d). If all capital 
investment in current oil and gas production were to cease immediately, global oil supply 
would fall by around 5.5 mb/d each year and natural gas output by 270 bcm. In 2010, these 
figures were 3.9 mb/d and 180 bcm respectively. Nearly 90% of upstream investment today 
is directed to offsetting declines rather than expanding capacity. 
Both the CPS and the STEPS see rising import dependence in major consuming regions, 
particularly Asia and Europe. Emerging market and developing economies in Asia, including 
China, are the destination for around 60% of the oil and gas exported worldwide in 2035 in 
both scenarios. Asia’s share of global oil imports increases in the STEPS from just over 70% 
today to 80% by 2050 (Figure 1.26). The Middle East remains the dominant oil exporter, 
sending out three-times more oil than the next-largest exporter in 2035. Oil and gas trade 
flows become increasingly dominated by exports from the Middle East to Asia. This increases 
the sector’s vulnerability to disruptions at key maritime chokepoints, including the Strait of 
Hormuz, the Strait of Malacca, the Suez Canal and Red Sea, and the Panama Canal, and at 
major ports in key exporting and importing regions. Oil and gas exports are also vulnerable

an area historically exposed to hurricane-related disruptions.

Where will all the LNG go?  
Since 2015, consumption of LNG has increased twice as fast as that of natural gas, and LNG 
overtook large-scale pipelines in 2023 as the predominant way of trading gas over long 
distances. The rise of LNG has reshaped global gas trade, opening new markets, upending 
established trade patterns, reconfiguring geopolitics and bolstering energy security for those 
countries able to afford it.  
LNG supply has tended to expand in cycles. After a relatively muted period of export capacity 
growth between 2020 and 2024, the period from 2025 to 2030 is set to see an 
unprecedented 300 bcm of new LNG export capacity come online (Figure 1.27),2 which will 
lead to a 50% increase in available global LNG supply. Based on projects currently under 
construction, more than half of the capacity is being built in the United States, and a further 
25% in Qatar. Unlike previous waves of capacity growth, around three-quarters of the new 
 
2 This translates into a 265 bcm increase in available LNG capacity, which takes into account maintenance 
work, unplanned outages and issues at upstream facilities, as well as 10 bcm of existing capacity that is set to 
shut by 2030. LNG demand in 2024 was 560 bcm.

supply is flexible, either as uncontracted gas that can be sold on the spot market or under a 
long-term contract with flexible destination clauses. The key questions, therefore, are in 
which markets, at what price and under what conditions this rising tide of LNG supply can be 
absorbed.  
Figure 1.27 ⊳ LNG capacity under development by supplying country,  
2010-2035 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
United States has driven global liquefaction capacity growth for the past decade 
 and it is set to expand its capacity by a further 160 bcm to 2035 
Note: bcm = billion cubic metres.  
1.8.1 Global LNG outlook to 2035 
In the CPS, global LNG demand increases by 260 bcm between 2024 and 2030 (Figure 1.28), 
absorbing the increase in available LNG capacity over this period. Gas prices reflect this 
demand pull, and are close to the long-run marginal cost of delivering LNG, which includes 
the full capital costs associated with developing liquefaction, shipping and regasification. 
Large, well-established importers such as China, Europe and Japan absorb around half of the 
increase in LNG supply to 2030. There are also large increases in LNG demand in emerging 
market and developing economies in Asia, but high gas prices limit the degree of uptake of 
natural gas in the CPS in lower income and more price-sensitive countries. By 2035, around 
20 bcm per year of LNG export capacity is required above what is currently existing and under 
development.  
In the STEPS, LNG demand increases by 200 bcm between 2024 and 2030. This is smaller than 
the change in available LNG export capacity, and puts downward pressure on LNG prices, 
bringing them close to short-run marginal costs. Stronger renewables growth, increased 
electrification, and more rapid efficiency gains in the STEPS lead to more LNG being crowded

out of the market in China and Europe than in the CPS. This frees up relatively low-cost LNG 
for price-sensitive consumers in other markets, notably in India and other parts of South and 
Southeast Asia, but – given their stated policy settings and continued efforts to electrify and 
deploy renewables – the increase in demand from these consumers is not sufficient to absorb 
all of the remaining wave of new LNG supply. This results in an overhang of available LNG 
capacity of around 65 bcm in 2030. The surplus is gradually worked off by 2035. 
Figure 1.28 ⊳ Existing and under construction available LNG export capacity 
and LNG trade by scenario to 2035 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
The large upcoming wave of additional LNG export capacity is fully absorbed in the CPS 
but results in well-supplied global gas markets in the STEPS through to 2035  
Note: CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 
Scenario. 
In the NZE Scenario, the sharp decrease in global natural gas demand means that many of 
the LNG projects currently under construction are no longer necessary. If they were to go 
ahead, aggregate capacity utilisation would fall to 75% in 2030 and 50% in 2035, and several 
plants that found themselves unable to compete in a supply glut would be likely to end up 
closing or being repurposed to trade hydrogen-based fuels such as ammonia or methanol. 
1.8.2 Advanced economies 
The European Union vastly increased its LNG imports after dramatic cuts to Russian pipeline 
deliveries in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Acutely aware of dependence 
on imported fossil fuels as a strategic vulnerability, the European Union has made clear that 
its efforts to reach net zero emissions are driven by security concerns as well as concerns 
about climate change.

Natural gas demand in the European Union peaked in 2010, and it fell by 20% between 2021 
and 2024. Demand is set to fall further, but LNG imports expand in both the CPS and the 
STEPS to 2035 as domestic production dwindles, and pipeline imports continue to decline. In 
the CPS, where the transition to low-emissions energy sources is slower than in the STEPS, 
gas demand falls by 35 bcm between 2024 and 2035, and LNG imports increase by 80 bcm. 
In the STEPS, demand falls by 75 bcm to 2035 as the European Union continues to electrify 
light industry and heating, and the increase in LNG imports is 35 bcm. Gas will nevertheless 
remain essential to EU energy security in both the CPS and the STEPS in the years ahead, 
providing power system stability and significant seasonal storage capabilities (Figure 1.29).

Strong demand from established importers raises prices in the CPS, moderating growth 
elsewhere; in the STEPS, ample supply and low prices boost LNG in developing Asia 
Japan and Korea are nearly fully dependent on imported LNG to meet domestic gas demand. 
In Japan, the prospects for additional LNG use depend to a large extent on nuclear restarts: 
every 1 GW of capacity brought back online would reduce LNG demand by around 1-1.5 bcm. 
In the CPS, LNG imports in Japan in 2035 reach around 100 bcm, 7% higher than 2024 levels; 
in the STEPS, there is a slight reduction in LNG imports. In Korea, LNG imports in the CPS are 
flat to 2035; in the STEPS, expanding use of renewables slightly lowers gas use in the power 
sector and offsets modest industrial gas demand growth, and LNG falls slightly to 2035.  
1.8.3 Emerging market and developing economies in Asia 
Since 2015, around 35% of global LNG supply growth has been absorbed by China, even 
though natural gas accounts for a relatively small share of its overall energy mix. This reflects 
significant gas infrastructure expansion, an opening of the domestic market, and broad-
based growth in demand.

China is a wild card for global LNG. Its LNG imports are set to be lower in 2025 than in recent 
years due to stronger domestic production, increased imports of pipeline gas from Russia, 
and muted gas demand growth. The deepening energy relationship between China and 
Russia, including the prospect of a second Power of Siberia pipeline, raises questions about 
China’s long-term appetite for additional LNG volumes. A key engine of gas demand growth 
in China in recent years has been light industry, which is projected to continue to electrify in 
the STEPS. Gas has also been used to meet rising power demand, but its share of the 
generation mix has remained around 3% since 2019, while the solar share has risen from 3% 
in 2019 to 8% in 2024. In the STEPS, LNG demand in China increases from 110 bcm in 2024 
to 165 bcm in 2035. LNG demand in the CPS in 2035 is higher at 180 bcm, due to slower 
electrification and renewables growth. 
Fast-growing emerging market and developing countries in Asia offer another major 
opportunity for future LNG demand growth. This diverse group of countries includes: 
established importers like Singapore; major current LNG producers such as Indonesia and 
Malaysia; and relative newcomers to the business of importing LNG such as Viet Nam and 
the Philippines. In India, LNG has been growing in recent years, driven by opportunistic 
buyers and strong potential growth in demand, especially in industry. In countries with 
mature domestic gas production, such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and 
Bangladesh, LNG is a logical replacement for declining domestic gas. In many of these 
countries, natural gas is viewed as a cleaner and more convenient alternative to coal and 
heavy fuel oil, and there are policies targeting improved air quality or programmes to expand 
gas infrastructure (Box 1.5).  
The critical variable affecting the scale of demand growth is price. In the STEPS, weighted 
average gas import prices in emerging market and developing countries in Asia are around 
USD 7.5 per million British thermal units (MBtu) in the 2030-2035 period, around 40% lower 
than today. This underpins significant LNG demand growth, especially in energy-hungry 
price-sensitive markets: in Southeast Asia LNG imports quadruple by 2035, and in India they 
triple. However, this growth depends on overcoming infrastructure constraints: in Southeast 
Asia, several regasification projects remain in the planning stages; in India, downstream 
infrastructure is insufficient to fully utilise some of its LNG terminals.  
Even at prices near to the short-run marginal cost of supply, LNG remains a premium fuel in 
a number of markets in Asia. Abundant supply may offer these countries significant 
optionality for security of supply reasons, and may help them to manage periods of system 
stress, but the economics of LNG make it difficult to penetrate these markets as a baseload 
fuel in the long run.  
1.8.4 Implications for exporters 
The period of LNG surplus in the STEPS makes it difficult for some exporters to fully recover 
their long-run marginal cost of supply, creating risks that project sponsors write off the value 
of the assets. The United States, as the most flexible supplier, sees the highest level of 
exposure to reduced rates of utilisation. This risk is borne primarily by those with equity or

trading positions in LNG supply in the United States, such as portfolio players, rather than by 
LNG liquefaction terminal owners, who primarily sell export capacity at terminals, whether 
it is used or not. Suppliers selling LNG cargoes on a long-term take-or-pay basis could also 
pass much of the volume and price risk to off-takers.  
However, the potential for LNG surpluses is not just a risk in the United States. The lower 
rates of LNG capacity utilisation in the STEPS become visible in exporters around the world 
as volume flexibility in existing contracts is fully exercised, legacy contracts are not renewed, 
and older plants with relatively high operating costs undergo prolonged maintenance or 
refurbishment.  
Box 1.5 ⊳ 
Can coal-to-gas switching absorb the wave of new LNG? 
A central argument made by those that maintain the coming wave of LNG supply can be 
fully absorbed is that cheap gas could displace coal, especially in emerging market and 
developing economies in Asia. The potential is indeed significant: global LNG supply today 
is equivalent to just eight weeks of coal use in China and India alone. 
Since 2010, around 30% of the 380 bcm of natural gas demand growth in emerging 
market and developing economies in Asia has come from coal-to-gas switching, and 
virtually all of this happened in China. In the STEPS, softer near-term market balances 
encourage additional switching of around 40 bcm between 2024 and 2030, primarily in 
China as well as other coal-rich price-sensitive markets in Asia. 
There is significant additional scope for coal-to-gas switching in 2030, although several 
factors limit this potential from being fully realised. For example, the role of coal in power 
generation is often shielded from market competition, with coal-fired plants operating in 
regulated markets or under long-term contracts guaranteeing minimum output 
(IEA, 2022). In addition, many industrial facilities and coal plants rely on cheap domestic 
coal; in practice the scope for switching using LNG is limited to plants using imported 
coal. There are also infrastructure and locational constraints, such as the capacity of 
electricity or gas grids to support near-term switching. 
Taking these factors into account, we estimate nearly 400 bcm of coal-to-gas switching 
potential in the power and industry sectors is technically feasible beyond what occurs in 
the STEPS (Figure 1.30). This is the short-term switching potential, i.e. electricity 
generation or industrial output that can switch from coal-fired units to gas-fired units 
based on facilities and infrastructure that exist in 2030.  
If delivered LNG prices were to fall to USD 5/MBtu, this would unlock an additional 
100 bcm of short term coal-to gas switching, mainly in China’s power sector. Further 
switching could occur if prices were to remain at this level for an extended period as this 
may encourage long-term decisions to replace existing or planned coal units with gas 
units instead, for example in power, steel or chemicals. However, the long-run marginal 
cost of global LNG supply is well above USD 5/MBtu and so it is unlikely that prices could 
remain around this level for a prolonged period.

There is ample manufacturing capacity for many clean 
energy technologies, especially solar PV and batteries: 
will we use it?  
Recent years have seen substantial investment in clean energy technology manufacturing. 
This has led to significant surplus capacity in the manufacturing of some key technologies 
(Figure 1.31). Global manufacturing capacity for PV modules was two-times higher than 
actual production in 2024, with a significant share of this production going into inventories; 
and three-times higher for battery cells. One of the key questions facing this Outlook is what 
happens to this surplus capacity in the context of increasing trade tensions, substantial 
pressure on technology prices, and falling profit margins for some technology producers. 
These themes and others impacting the future of clean energy technology manufacturing 
and trade will be explored in more detail in the forthcoming edition of Energy Technology 
Perspectives.  
Much of this surplus capacity is in China. Since the largest outlet for its manufacturing 
capacity is its own huge domestic market, what happens in that market has a critical bearing 
on whether this capacity will be used. In recent years, the rapid growth of renewables 
deployment, EV sales and battery storage installations in China has been partly driven by 
aggressive pricing and competition as its producers seek market share. Curtailment rates of 
wind and solar have ticked up recently, and China raised its wind and solar PV curtailment

Both the STEPS and CPS see continued momentum behind clean energy technology

policy support. Electric cars account for more than 90% of passenger car sales in China in 
both the CPS and the STEPS by 2035, up from around 50% in 2024; electric freight truck sales 
account for more than 50% of sales by the same year, up from just over 20% of the market 
in the first-half of 2025. In 2024, wind and solar PV accounted for 18% of electricity 
generation in China. In the STEPS, their combined share of total generation reaches roughly 
50% by 2035. In the CPS, it is around five percentage points lower because less capacity is 
added and curtailment rates are higher in this scenario.

China’s exports of clean energy technologies have increased by around four-times since 2019 
and now account for around 5% of China’s total goods exports. In the first-half of 2025, 
around two-thirds of these exports by value went to advanced economies and around one-
third to emerging market and developing economies (Figure 1.32). This mix looks somewhat 
different by technology. Emerging market and developing economies accounted for over half 
of China’s exports of solar PV equipment in 2025, but only one-quarter of battery exports. 
Exports by nominal value underplay the continuing growth in the scale of China’s clean 
energy technology exports, as many of these technologies have experienced substantial price 
deflation in recent years.

manufactured low-cost electric cars are seeing rapid sales growth in some other emerging 
market and developing economies, and EV sales shares are now larger than in advanced 
economies in some cases (IEA, 2025e). 
The dominance of China in global clean energy technology manufacturing and its surging 
exports have triggered concerns among a number of countries. China’s manufactured goods 
surplus increased from around USD 1 trillion in 2019 to around USD 2 trillion in 2024, two-
times faster than the rate from 2010 to 2019. Its extensive industrial policies, which are 
opaque and difficult to quantify, have been estimated to cost around 2-4% of GDP: this is far 
more than in advanced economies (IMF, 2025). 
A highly competitive market, high rates of innovation, and extensive government support 
enable China to produce energy technologies at very low cost.  However, in some cases, such 
as solar PV panels, current low prices are unsustainable, and companies are losing money 
(IEA, 2025f). Countries have responded by raising trade barriers, including targeting energy 
technologies such as EVs and solar PV. In response, Chinese companies have pledged around 
USD 230 billion in clean energy-related manufacturing investments overseas. China has also 
sought – thus far unsuccessfully – to promote consolidation in some of its clean energy 
technology manufacturing sectors. 
Energy transitions hinge on sound domestic policy frameworks. For example, large-scale 
imports of solar PV in some cases are driven by defections from a dysfunctional central grid. 
Distributed solar PV can bring substantial benefits: it can reduce consumer costs, cut fuel 
import bills, and provide a first rung of energy access for underserved communities. 
However, distributed generation can also accelerate revenue losses for distribution 
companies. A fragmented electricity sector, with chronically weak distribution companies, is 
unlikely to provide a lasting basis for economic growth. In the case of EVs, infrastructure 
provision is essential to support high and expanding sales levels, and this requires effective 
policy and planning.  
Key questions for the outlook therefore include whether international markets remain open 
to clean energy technology trade and investment, and whether domestic policy frameworks 
can learn and adapt to support energy transitions driven by disruptive, commercially 
available technologies. In the CPS, these obstacles to the diffusion of new technologies loom 
large, creating significant pressure on new energy industries to consolidate in order to lift 
utilisation rates and ensure profitability. In the STEPS, these constraints are less binding, and 
global deployment trends allow for more diversified clean technology value chains to emerge 
over time. However, only in more rapid energy transition outlooks like the NZE Scenario does 
the world fully utilise today’s manufacturing capacity and then expand it.  
Wind and solar PV show how the dynamics play out in the CPS and the STEPS. Together they 
met around one-fifth of electricity generation in advanced economies in 2024. In the CPS, 
this rises to around one-third by 2035, building on policy support and market 
competitiveness in many of these countries (Figure 1.33). Faster transitions in the STEPS see 
the share rise to two-fifths by 2035. In China, wind and solar PV reach around 45% of total 
generation by 2035 but are held back from increasing further by rising curtailment rates and

challenges of grid integration. In the STEPS, market reforms and additional investment in 
grids, flexibility and storage see this share rise to nearly 50%, leading to substantial declines 
in coal generation. In emerging market and developing economies other than China, there is 
a substantial rise in the share of wind and solar PV in both the CPS and the STEPS, although 
it is more pronounced in the STEPS.

car sales by region and scenario, 2024-2035

Clean energy deployment expands in all scenarios, but is held back by weaker policy 
frameworks and growing system integration challenges in the CPS 
Note: CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; EMDE = emerging market and 
developing economies. 
EVs are also important in this context. They are highly competitive in the Chinese market, 
and achieve high levels of penetration in 2035 in both the STEPS and the CPS. In other 
emerging market and developing economies, EV sales shares essentially flatline in the CPS as 
many of them lack explicit, longer term supportive policies. In advanced economies, the 
STEPS sees rapid growth of EV sales, with the sales share increasing from around 15% today 
to around 55% in 2035; in the CPS, it reaches 45%.  
1.10 Where are the gaps in global energy investment?  
Energy investment worldwide exceeded USD 3.2 trillion in 2024 and is expected to reach 
USD 3.3 trillion in 2025 (IEA, 2025g). The future trajectory for energy investment varies by 
scenario. In the CPS, average annual energy investment between 2025 and 2035 remains 
similar to 2024 levels; in the STEPS, it reaches over USD 3.4 trillion; in the NZE Scenario, it 
reaches nearly USD 4.8 trillion. In this section, we analyse what these energy investment 
projections tell us about potential gaps and risks.

1.10.1 By fuel and technology 
Our analysis of current energy investment flows and future needs by fuel and technology 
raises three main concerns. First is energy efficiency. The rate at which global energy 
efficiency is improving, as measured by the energy intensity of global GDP, slowed in recent 
years. There are several reasons including significant gaps in the coverage of efficiency 
standards and the lack of stringency in some of the standards that do exist. For example, 
around 40% of newly built floor area is not yet covered by efficiency requirements, and the 
regulations in place vary significantly among countries in their scope and stringency. 
Similarly, just three-out-of-five industrial electric motors in use globally are covered by 
minimum energy performance standards. While spending on end-use electrification is rising, 
notably for EVs, investment in technical efficiency improvements to help deliver more 
efficient housing stock or equipment has been flatter. Additional investment to help deliver 
such improvements could bring benefits for energy security, cut energy bills and reduce the 
environmental impact of energy use. 
The second concern relates to grids and other investment in electricity security. Overall 
spending in the power sector has surged in recent years: investment in today’s power sector 
now accounts for over 40% of energy sector spending, and this level rises to over 50% when 
investment in end-use electrification is included. However, the rise in investment has been 
uneven. Annual investment in power generation increased from around USD 600 billion in 
2015 to over USD 1 trillion today, led by a massive expansion in spending on solar PV.  
Spending on grids has risen much more gradually to around USD 400 billion. Ten years ago, 
for every dollar spent on generation, around USD 0.60 was spent on transmission and 
distribution networks. The comparable figure today is around USD 0.40.  
Grid investment is not just a question of money, important as that is. Significant practical 
impediments to getting grid-related projects off the ground include slow permitting 
processes and tight supply chains for transformers, cables and other components. Around 
1 700 GW of renewable energy projects at advanced stages of development are being held 
up today because grid connections are not available. Much more needs to be done to ensure 
that these and other projects can proceed quickly. Adequate investment in networks also 
needs to be accompanied by spending on dispatchable sources of generation and on other 
sources of power system flexibility and stability, including storage and demand-side response 
measures.  
Third is the concern more broadly for investment in support of energy transitions. 
Investment that tackles global emissions typically involves higher upfront costs that are 
offset over time by much lower operating expenditures, mainly through lower fuel costs. This 
is a major reason why the investment levels in the NZE Scenario are higher than in the 
exploratory scenarios (Figure 1.34). The largest gaps over the next ten years are for energy 
efficiency and end-use electrification, where annual investment more than doubles from 
current levels to reach USD 1.7 trillion on average between 2025 and 2035 in the 
NZE Scenario. Compared with the CPS and the STEPS, there are also significant increases in 
the NZE Scenario for annual investment in renewable power and low-emissions fuels. All 
scenarios see a continued rise in spending on nuclear power.

power generation and fuels, grids and storage, and end-use electrification

In other sectors the gaps between current investment levels and the scenario projections are 
less pronounced. Recent average spending of about USD 825 billion on oil and gas supply is 
only marginally below the annual investment needs in the CPS, USD 890 billion, and slightly 
above what is needed in the STEPS, USD 800 billion, over the next decade. Much less is 
required in the NZE Scenario. In all scenarios, the vast majority of upstream spending on oil 
and gas is to offset declines in production from existing fields. All scenarios see a continued 
need for mining operations, including a rising need for critical minerals. In the NZE Scenario, 
overall extractive operations fall dramatically, despite the increased call for battery metals, 
copper and rare earth elements for a more electrified and renewables-rich system (Box 1.6).

Box 1.6 ⊳ 
How much material is extracted in our scenarios? 
The global energy system requires the extraction of vast quantities of materials from 
fossil fuels to critical minerals. The total weight of useful products for the energy system 
was around 17 billion tonnes in 2024. Even larger quantities of material are extracted to 
deliver these useful products (Figure 1.35). Operators must remove and handle material 
such as waste rock, drilling cuttings, slag, water and sludge. On average, around 7 tonnes 
of material, mostly rock and water, are extracted for every tonne of coal produced. For 
every tonne of oil produced, nearly 6 tonnes of water and other residues are extracted. 
Critical minerals require far larger amounts of material to be processed: for typical ore 
grades, more than 100 tonnes of residue are extracted for every tonne of mineral 
produced. For example, ore grades are usually below 1% for copper, resulting in more 
than one hundred parts of material being extracted to obtain one part of copper. Much 
less material is usually involved in gas extraction, with less than 1 tonne of water and 
drilling cuttings extracted for each tonne of natural gas produced.

Raw material extraction of fossil fuels and critical minerals  
by scenario, 2000-2050 
 
IEA. CC BY 4.0. 
Despite the increase in critical mineral extraction, the total amount of  
raw material for the energy system declines in all scenarios 
Notes: CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 
Scenario. Critical minerals include lithium, copper, nickel, cobalt, graphite and magnet rare earths. 
In total, we estimate that around 120 billion tonnes of raw materials related to fossil fuels 
and critical minerals were extracted from the earth in 2024, of which coal production 
accounted for more than half of the total. The weight of energy-related materials 
extracted falls slightly by 2035 in the CPS, mainly because of declines in coal mining. This 
reduction is more pronounced in the STEPS and even more so in the NZE Scenario, despite

an increase in extraction related to critical minerals. Less raw material extraction implies 
less land-use change and environmental degradation, lower energy use and a decrease 
in emissions and water use.  
1.10.2 By country and region 
At a country and regional level, many of the most striking gaps in energy investment are in 
emerging market and developing economies, with the notable exception of China. As 
detailed in section 1.1.1, these are the economies that take over as the primary drivers of 
energy demand growth, with India and Indonesia in the lead.  In many cases, however, these 
are also the economies that have faced difficulties to mobilise sufficient capital to meet their 
increasing needs for energy infrastructure. In Africa, energy investment today is around one-
third below where it was ten years ago because a large drop in spending on fossil fuel supply 
has only been partially offset by a rise in other areas. This is a particular concern given strong 
expected population growth in Africa and the large number of people that continue to lack 
access to electricity and clean cooking.  
How emerging market and developing economies meet their rising energy needs is a pivotal 
question for the energy outlook. Analysis and surveys conducted for the IEA Cost of Capital 
Observatory highlight some of the issues that can deter investment. A key issue is that the 
cost of capital for power generation projects in emerging market and developing economies 
is over twice as high as it is in advanced economies. This reflects higher real and perceived 
risks at the country, sectoral and project levels. A high cost of capital pushes up financing 
costs and makes it much more difficult to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, especially 
for relatively capital-intensive investment in clean technologies. 
Broad country-related risks and macroeconomic factors typically explain a large share of 
country-by-country variations in the cost of capital. For example, investors may have 
concerns about the rule of law and sanctity of contracts, or about currency fluctuations and 
convertibility. As the balance of capital spending on energy in emerging market and 
developing economies shifts from globally traded commodities such as oil towards projects 
that rely on domestically generated revenues, notably in the electricity sector, the quality 
and predictability of the business environment are likely to become even more important for 
investors. There are also risks that can be addressed directly by energy policy makers and 
regulators, notably regarding the reliability of payment, availability of transmission 
infrastructure and land, and how these issues are defined in contracts.  
A positive aspect of the Outlook is that, in our scenarios, most of the required investment in 
emerging market and developing economies over the next ten years is in mature 
technologies and in sectors with tried and tested policy formulas for success (Figure 1.36). 
Nonetheless, scaling up investment remains a major challenge, especially if national energy 
and sustainability objectives are to be met in full. Success will depend to a large extent on 
more private sector involvement; on well-co-ordinated, enhanced international financial and 
technical support; and on the creation of deeper domestic capital markets and financial 
systems in developing economies that can channel savings towards productive investments.

and developing economies across all scenarios 
Note: MER = market exchange rate; CPS = Current Policies Scenario; STEPS = Stated Policies Scenario;

In the NZE Scenario, for example, we estimate that international public finance of about 
USD 120 billion per year is needed to mobilise both domestic and international private 
capital. With development finance budgets falling, these limited resources must shift from 
providing direct funding at senior tranches towards riskier junior and first loss tranches.   
Where equity is in short supply, they also need to be used to provide more equity capital. To 
achieve mobilisation at scale, leverage ratios need to rise sharply. Every dollar of 
international public finance today mobilises USD 0.60 of private capital, and the aim should 
be to see that ratio rise to at least five to seven dollars. At a regional level, Africa needs to be 
a priority given the imbalances in current capital flows.

Chapter 2 
Setting the scene 
Context and scenario design 
• All sources of energy increased in 2024 to meet the world’s rising energy needs.  
Electricity use expanded rapidly across a range of sectors. Deployment of renewable 
power generation again broke records in 2024, meeting more than 70% of the 
increase in electricity demand. Consumption of each of the fossil fuels rose. Global 
energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reached another all-time high. 
• The energy sector faces many uncertainties. The global economy is projected to grow 
at an average rate of 3% in the 2024-2030 period, but changes in the global policy 
environment and trade outlook could lead to different outcomes. In parallel, a drift 
towards greater fragmentation and increased geopolitical rivalry could have major 
implications for energy-related trade flows. These uncertainties underscore the value 
of supply diversification and resilient supply chains, notably for critical minerals.   
• Energy policies continue to evolve. The United States enhanced its backing for 
domestic fossil fuels and nuclear energy, while cutting support for wind, solar and 
electric vehicles. Many other countries also launched new policy initiatives in the last 
year, including a boost in policies designed to enhance energy security. Meanwhile, 
major gaps persist in the world’s provision of energy: 730 million people still lack 
access to electricity and nearly 2 billion are without access to clean cooking. 
• These new starting conditions are reflected in a fully revised and updated set of 
scenarios in this World Energy Outlook (WEO). All take as their starting point the same 
GDP and population assumptions. None of the scenarios are forecasts.  
• The Current Policies Scenario (CPS) considers a snapshot of policies and regulations 
that are already in place and offers a generally cautious perspective on the speed at 
which new energy technologies can be deployed in the energy system. 
• The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) considers the application of a broader range of 
policies, including those that have been formally tabled but not yet adopted as well 
as other official strategy documents that indicate the direction of travel. Barriers to 
the introduction of new technologies are lower than in the CPS, but this scenario does 
not assume that aspirational targets are met. 
• Further scenarios have normative elements and work towards defined outcomes. The 
Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario maps out an updated global pathway for 
the energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. An additional scenario, 
the Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario (ACCESS), is 
introduced in this WEO, setting out a data-driven roadmap to achieve universal access 
to electricity and clean cooking.

2.1 
Introduction 
The World Energy Outlook-2025 (WEO-2025) unfolds against an uncertain and unpredictable 
backdrop. Some key energy-producing countries are either parties to ongoing conflicts, 
notably Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, or vulnerable to spillovers 
from instability in the Middle East. At the same time, the economic outlook remains clouded 
by tensions over trade, fiscal weaknesses and high levels of debt. Worries about the security 
and affordability of energy supply spiked during the global energy crisis in 2022, and 
governments are reaching different conclusions about the best ways to respond. Meanwhile, 
rapid technological change continues, accelerating the rollout of energy technologies like 
batteries and the advance of artificial intelligence (AI). 
Despite this turbulence, demand for energy services is rising as the global economy grows 
and the world’s population increases, and electricity is playing an increasingly important role 
in meeting rising demand. It is also clear that difficult challenges lie ahead. Many people 
around the world still do not enjoy the benefits that modern energy can bring, while 
emissions from the energy sector are closely bound up with the risks and impacts of a 
changing climate, which are becoming clearer with each passing year.  
There can be no single or simple view on how the global energy outlook might develop. This 
is why the WEO includes a suite of updated scenarios, each based on a different set of 
assumptions about the policies, technologies and other factors that shape the outlook. None 
of these scenarios should be viewed as a forecast. Our aim is not to predict what will happen, 
but to provide a rigorous, data-driven framework for decision makers to consider their 
options and the consequences of different choices. 
This chapter sets the scene for the WEO by providing the broad energy and macroeconomic 
context, and by noting the new policies and geopolitical developments that shape the 
starting point for the analysis. It then introduces the revised set of WEO scenarios, which 
reflect a spectrum of possible outcomes, and discusses the inputs and assumptions that 
underpin them. 
There are two exploratory scenarios, the Current Policies Scenario (CPS) and the Stated 
Policies Scenario (STEPS), that examine different ways in which existing policies and policy 
announcements affect the development of the energy system. These scenarios do not 
assume that aspirational targets or objectives are met. 
There are also pathways with normative elements, that map out ways to achieve specific 
energy or climate goals. The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario provides an updated 
pathway that brings emissions from the energy sector to net zero by mid-century. 
Chapter 6 introduces for the first time the Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity 
Services Scenario (ACCESS) which charts an ambitious yet feasible pathway to universal 
access to clean cooking and electricity.

Context for the World Energy Outlook-2025 
2.2.1 
Energy demand, investment, technology and emissions trends 
Energy demand and electricity generation 
Total global energy demand continues to increase, rising by 2% in 2024 to more than 
650 exajoules (EJ). Fossil fuels accounted for nearly four-fifths of total energy demand – a 
share that has decreased only marginally since 2000 (Figure 2.1). More substantial changes 
have occurred in the geographical breakdown of demand. In 2000, advanced economies 
accounted for more than half of global energy demand, but their demand peaked in 2007 
and their share of global demand fell to one-third in 2024, which is much lower than their 
share of global gross domestic product (GDP) (measured at market exchange rates). By 
contrast, energy demand in emerging market and developing economies, led by China, has 
more than doubled since 2000. Overall energy demand increased by over 20% since 2010. 
Reductions in energy intensity averaged around 2% per year from 2010 to 2019, which 
mitigated the impact of rising demand, but recent years have seen a deceleration, and energy 
intensity fell by only 1.1% in 2024.

renewables and natural gas began to play a larger role in global electricity generation. Today, 
coal demand growth is driven by emerging market and developing economies in Asia, while 
demand in advanced economies has declined by half from its 2007 peak. Oil and natural gas 
have both grown at a relatively steady rate since 2010, with average annual increases of 
1.4 EJ and 2.4 EJ respectively. Growth in demand for renewables has accelerated, increasing 
by around 3 EJ per year on average over the last decade in primary energy terms. 
Total global energy demand increased in 2024 by over 2%, much more than the long-term 
average of 1.4% (2010-2023), partly as a result of soaring cooling demand amid record 
heatwaves. Renewables met much of this growth, rising by 5 EJ on the back of significant 
capacity additions for wind and solar PV (photovoltaics), and the cyclical recovery from a 
poor year for hydro in 2023. Natural gas demand also rose faster than in recent years.  
The jump in energy demand in 2024 was driven in particular by a surge of 1 100 terawatt-
hours (TWh) in electricity demand, which was nearly twice the long-term average. Over half 
of this surge in 2024 was in the buildings sector. The record increase in electricity generation 
from wind and solar PV in 2024, totalling nearly 700 TWh, was enough to meet 60% of the 
growth in electricity demand. Other renewables also expanded output well above recent 
trends. Nuclear power demonstrated a strong increase as a result of reactor restarts in 
advanced economies and new nuclear power plants in emerging market and developing 
economies. Long-term trends for electricity generation from fossil fuels indicate a slowdown 
in the increase of generation both from coal and natural gas (Figure 2.2).

Total final consumption across end-use sectors increased by nearly 2% in 2024, rising faster 
than the average since 2010 and reaching over 450 EJ for the first time. This reflects, in part, 
a recent uptick in global energy consumption in industry, especially electricity-intensive 
manufacturing and oil-based feedstock for petrochemicals (Figure 2.3). The growth of energy 
consumption in industry, however, slowed markedly over the course of the last decade, not 
least as a result of economic restructuring in China, where industrial coal consumption 
peaked in 2014. Energy consumption in the transport sector also increased, though the 
growth of oil consumption in transport has been slowing as electric vehicles (EVs) and 
biofuels displace oil demand growth. Aviation and shipping accounted for all the 1 EJ increase 
in transport oil consumption in 2024, with oil demand for road transport flat. The long-term 
trend in the buildings sector is one of relatively linear increases in demand, averaging slightly 
more than 1 EJ per year since 2010. However, 2024 witnessed a larger increase in energy 
demand from buildings, mostly in the form of electricity. Record temperatures drove higher 
cooling needs, while demand rose for uses such as data centres and AI services.

Note: EJ = exajoule. 
Major gaps in global energy access persist, with many communities underserved or without 
any access to modern energy. Some progress has resumed since the disruption caused by 
the Covid pandemic and the global energy crisis, but the latest tracking data indicate that 
730 million people around the world remain without access to electricity, largely in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Nearly 2 billion people still lack access to clean cooking. Instead, they rely 
on traditional stoves and open fires, which expose households to harmful smoke and

contribute to around 3 million premature deaths each year. The lack of access to modern 
energy also constrains efforts to increase economic prosperity, improve  access to education 
and meet a range of other objectives. 
Energy investment 
Investment in the energy sector rose to US dollars (USD) 3.2 trillion in 2024, up from an 
annual average of USD 2.6 trillion over the previous decade (Figure 2.4). The share of 
investment for sectors other than fossil fuels has risen quickly: low-emissions power, grids, 
low-emissions fuels, efficiency and end-use sector spending together accounted for 
USD 1 trillion ten years ago, which was less than 40% of the global total, but increased to 
over USD 2 trillion in 2024, accounting for more than 60% of the total.  
Figure 2.4 ⊳ 
Global energy-related investment, 2015-2024

Energy-related investment increased sharply from 2020, led by more spending  
on renewables, grids and storage, efficiency and end-use sectors  
Notes: MER = market exchange rate. Low-emissions fuels include modern bioenergy, low-emissions hydrogen-
based fuels and carbon capture, utilisation and storage associated with fossil fuels, including direct air capture.  
Spending on low-emissions power generation, notably solar PV, has almost doubled over the 
past five years.  Investment in electricity grids is rising too, but is struggling to keep pace with 
the growth in power demand and rapid deployment of renewables. Nuclear investment is on 
a smaller scale, but is making a comeback, rising by over 70% over the past five years. 
Approvals of new gas-fired power have also risen, led by the United States and the Middle 
East, while fast growing electricity use and concerns about electricity security have spurred 
a wave of coal plant approvals in China. Weakening oil prices and demand expectations have 
weighed on upstream oil investment, which remains well below levels seen prior to the 
Covid-19 pandemic.

The geographic spread of energy investment is uneven and evolving: China is by far the 
world’s largest energy investor. Its share of global clean energy investment rose from around 
25% ten years ago to almost 30% today. At the other end of the scale, many developing 
economies, especially in Africa, struggle to mobilise capital for energy infrastructure. 
Energy technologies 
Several energy technologies have seen substantial cost reductions and performance 
improvements in recent years. The global average prices of both solar PV and electric vehicle 
batteries fell by more than 80% between 2014 and 2024. As a result, the levelised cost of 
electricity from solar PV is now among the lowest of any power technology in history, 
although a fuller assessment of competitiveness should also include the value that different 
technologies bring to electricity systems (see Chapter 4, Box 4.4). Total system costs, 
including grid infrastructure, provide a comprehensive view of the impact of technology 
choice on electricity affordability (see Chapter 1, section 1.4). With the fall in battery prices, 
electric cars often have a lower total cost of ownership than internal combustion engine (ICE) 
equivalents. In some markets, most notably in China, they often also have a lower upfront 
purchase cost than equivalent ICE models (IEA, 2025a). On the other hand, capital cost 
reductions in wind power have been muted in recent years, due to higher commodity prices 
and supply chain constraints. The upstream oil and gas sector continues to experience some 
upward pressure on costs, partly as a result of expenses arising from technology 
development and deployment, though this has been offset to some extent by increases in 
capital efficiency (IEA, 2025b).

Solar PV capacity additions increased by ten-times from 2015 to 2024, with nearly 
540 gigawatts (GW) added in 2024 (Figure 2.5). Capacity additions for wind increased from 
65 GW in 2015 to around 115 GW in 2024, although annual trends show some volatility in 
individual years. Capacity additions of coal and natural gas-fired power plants halved from a 
total of 160 GW in 2015 to around 80 GW in 2024. However, the announced pipeline for new 
natural gas-fired power plants has jumped in recent years. Announced project pipelines for 
coal-fired plants rose after several years in which project cancellations outpaced new 
announcements. Capacity additions of hydropower and nuclear have been broadly stable at 
around 26 GW per year and 8 GW per year respectively since 2015.  
Sales of electric cars continued to expand in 2024, accounting for over 20% of the global car 
market. Global sales of ICE cars decreased by 1.5% in 2024 and are now almost one-quarter 
lower than in 2017, the year in which ICE car sales reached their highest point. Pure battery 
electric vehicles sales reached over 10 million in 2024, up fivefold since 2020. Building on 
similar underlying cost reductions, capacity additions of battery storage in the electricity 
sector in 2024 were more than 60-times higher than in 2015, reaching nearly 80 GW.  
Projects to capture energy-related CO2 emissions have only resulted in an operational 
capture capacity of around 50 million tonnes per year. Projects under construction look to 
more than double this capacity by 2030. Hydrogen production worldwide has increased by 
nearly 20% since 2015, though less than 1% of this was low-emissions hydrogen production. 
Low-emissions hydrogen production from projects that are operational, under construction 
or have reached a final investment decision is set to reach 4.2 million tonnes per year by 
2030, representing a fivefold increase compared with 2024, but still well below government 
and industry ambitions at the start of this decade. 
Energy-related emissions and climate change 
Global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reached an all-time high of 
38.2 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2024, while energy-related emissions of methane remained at about 
4.4 Gt CO2-equivalent. The annual pace of increase in CO2 emissions slowed to below 1% in 
2024, with emissions continuing to decouple from economic growth at the global level. Most 
of the increase in emissions in 2024 was from natural gas, followed by coal. Low-emissions 
energy technologies – solar PV, wind, nuclear, electric cars and heat pumps – deployed since 
2019 now prevent 2.6 Gt CO2 annually, equal to 7% of global emissions (IEA, 2025c).  
In advanced economies, total energy-related CO2 emissions fell by 1% in 2024, 20% below 
the peak level in 2007, but this decline was more than offset by increases elsewhere. Most 
of the global 2024 increase came from emerging market and developing economies other 
than China, where CO2 emissions rose by 2.4%. Emissions growth in China slowed in 2024, 
but its per capita emissions are nevertheless now 16% higher than in the advanced 
economies as a group (Figure 2.6).  
It is notable that 2024 was the warmest year ever recorded, with the global mean near-
surface temperature about 1.55 degree Celsius (°C) above pre-industrial levels (WMO, 2025).  
It was also confirmed as the first calendar year in which the average global temperature was

more than 1.5 °C above its pre-industrial level.1 Extreme temperatures and climate change 
can affect the energy system in a number of ways, for example by pushing up electricity 
demand for cooling, increasing wildfire risks to energy infrastructure and affecting the 
efficiency of power plants and transmission lines (see Chapter 5). Extreme heat increased 
electricity demand in 2024, especially for cooling, contributing to the rise in energy-related 
CO₂ emissions (IEA, 2025c). If the weather in 2024 had been the same as in 2023, about half 
of the increase in global emissions would have been avoided.

Macroeconomic and geopolitical context 
Macroeconomic trends 
Forecasts for global economic growth have been revised up since earlier in 2025. The 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) now projects the global economy to grow by 3.2% in 2025 
and 3.1% in 2026 (IMF, 2025a). This increase comes despite headwinds caused by geopolitical 
instability and uncertainty about tariffs, highlighting the robustness of the global economy.

Emerging market and developing economies are projected to grow by 4.2% in 2025 and 4% 
in 2026, and advanced economies by 1.6% in both years (IMF, 2025a). Poverty reduction in 
emerging market and developing economies slowed during the Covid-19 pandemic, and 
stronger inclusive growth will be critical to reversing this (World Bank, 2025a).  
Inflationary pressures have continued to ease in many countries, following spikes linked to 
the easing of lockdowns in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and to the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine. One important contributory factor has been the continued moderation in global 
energy prices, despite geopolitical tensions. In part, this reflects adjustments in market 
balances for oil and gas, as highlighted in the WEO-2024. This cooling of inflation has allowed 
for a relaxation of monetary policy in many jurisdictions (Figure 2.7).

There are plenty of near-term uncertainties that bear on the economic outlook: notably the 
path for inflation and interest rates; the outcomes of current trade negotiations; the 
prospects for equity markets, some of which are trading at historically elevated valuations; 
and the course of political and geopolitical developments. There are also plenty of 
uncertainties about the global economy in the longer term, but a number of key structural 
trends have implications for the future (Figure 2.8).  
One of these is that the benefits of growth in global GDP per capita over the last decade have 
been uneven. Emerging market and developing economies other than China, as a group, have

not caught up relative to advanced economies through faster growth. Whether this trend 
can be reversed will have important implications not only for poverty reduction but also for 
global energy demand trends in the decades to come.

Another notable trend is the rise in government debt as a percentage of GDP in both 
advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies. This risks potentially 
hampering efforts to invest in key infrastructure and implement energy policies that require 
a fiscal outlay, such as energy subsidies. It may also have knock-on effects such as higher 
long-term interest rates.

Birthrates meanwhile have continued to decline across much of the world in recent years, in 
some cases substantially faster than expected on the basis of official forecasts. Declining 
birthrates and higher dependency ratios are likely to create a drag on GDP growth and 
increase fiscal pressures.  
Another macroeconomic issue relates to the outlook for geopolitics and its potential impact 
on trade and growth. Although trade volumes continue to expand, there has been a notable 
rise in the use of restrictive trade measures, including measures that place restrictions on 
access to technologies. Future developments in this area could have important implications 
for the macroeconomic and energy sector outlooks.  
Political and geopolitical uncertainties 
In a fragile international environment, energy-related trade has become increasingly subject 
to geopolitical considerations. The most obvious example is the reorientation of European 
energy imports following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, when Russia sought to gain 
political leverage by withholding natural gas supplies and exposing European consumers to 
higher energy bills. In response, European Union imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), 
picked up sharply, particularly from the United States which accounted for 55% of EU LNG 
imports in the first half of 2025. The period of energy market volatility that followed Russia’s 
invasion also saw an acceleration in the deployment of renewables and efforts to increase 
energy efficiency in some key markets as governments sought to reduce fuel import bills.  
At the same time, attention is turning to risks in some newer value chains related to critical 
minerals and key energy technologies. These include risks arising from market concentration: 
the average market share of the top-three countries undertaking the refining of key energy 
minerals rose from around 82% in 2020 to 86% in 2024 (Figure 2.9). While many supply chain 
issues are not related to the geopolitical context, notable vulnerabilities have been 
exacerbated by recent policy developments. Since early 2025, for example, China has 
introduced a range of export controls on rare earth magnets, which are key to electric motor 
and generator components used in various energy-related technologies as well as in other 
strategic economic sectors. Due to these restrictions, exports from China of these key 
components fell by 75% between April and June 2025 impacting manufacturing activities in 
Europe and the United States. Concerns about supply chains – both in the energy sector and 
more broadly – are leading to a rise in industrial policies and strategies, as well as a series of 
new international partnerships. 
A fragile international environment also heightens potential risks associated with energy 
infrastructure and transit routes. These include risks related to key maritime routes, 
undersea infrastructure and electricity grids. International maritime shipping of energy 
products remains particularly sensitive to potential disruption at key chokepoints, including 
the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Hormuz, the Suez Canal and Red Sea, and the Panama 
Canal.  There are also risks to energy infrastructure arising from vulnerabilities in the digital 
world: as energy systems have become increasingly electrified, integrated and connected, 
their vulnerability to cyberattacks has increased.

Against this background, governments face a difficult balancing act as they seek to manage 
potential trade-offs while trying to align as far as possible the goals of energy security, energy 
transitions, supply chain security, affordability and industrial policy. The approaches they 
take and the results they achieve will have a critical bearing on the outlook for energy.

Energy policy developments 
Energy policies and regulations have critical influence on the direction of the energy sector. 
However, their impact is not always clear cut. Policies may have ill-defined or ambiguous 
objectives, can overachieve or undershoot their original goals, are subject to change over 
time and may be only near term in focus. Other factors such as market, price and technology 
trends also play crucial roles in shaping the direction of the energy sector. Nonetheless, given 
their importance, the International Energy Agency (IEA) tracks energy policies closely and 
maintains an up-to-date database of policies and measures covering 85 countries (IEA, 
2025f).   
IEA policy tracking indicates that the last year has seen major new policies emerge in 
48 countries covering a wide range of objectives and instruments, from energy performance 
standards to government financial incentives and pricing schemes. In this section we survey 
policy initiatives across multiple countries and sectors, including the new direction for energy 
policy in the United States. We also include a spotlight looking at the burgeoning adoption 
of measures related to energy security and emergency response.

The United States has made major changes to its federal priorities for energy research, 
investment and resource development. These changes are focused on removing obstacles to 
the development and use of domestic oil, natural gas and coal, and supporting nuclear 
energy and other technologies such as geothermal, while rolling back energy efficiency 
measures and reducing support for solar and wind power generation, and EVs (Box 2.1). 
The number of countries adopting regulations for energy performance standards saw a 
notable increase in the 2010s. These include emissions and fuel economy standards for 
vehicles and minimum energy performance standards for appliances and industrial motors. 
Major energy consuming countries adopted such standards early on, but the level of 
coverage plateaued in the 2020s (Figure 2.10). The recent repeal of efficiency measures in 
the United States reduces the policy coverage in several sectors. Renewable energy policies 
have seen similar trends, with a significant rise in policy adoption for power generation since 
2010, and also a shift from use of feed-in tariffs to an increasing role for tendering and 
auctions.  
The scale of funding commitments and disbursements for various energy-related 
programmes has increased substantially since 2020, thanks in large part to provisions in post-
Covid-19 recovery plans put in place by advanced economies. New government support 
earmarked for the deployment of clean energy technologies and infrastructure since the 
pandemic totals over USD 2 trillion, although actual disbursements vary across countries and 
sectors. 
Box 2.1 ⊳ 
United States energy policy changes course 
In the past five years, the United States has seen very significant federal energy policy 
changes. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025 in several respects represents a 
substantial change in direction for the energy sector, when compared to legislation such 
as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. 
Policy changes in the United States can have a major impact on long-term energy trends 
globally as well as domestically. For example, together the shale revolution and the 
2015 reversal of the US ban on crude oil exports fundamentally reshaped global oil 
markets and geopolitics, positioning the United States as the world’s leading oil producer, 
and at the same time bringing about lower prices and increased resilience in the face of 
oil supply disruptions. The rise of US shale is also an example of the way that multiple 
factors drive change in the energy sector: energy policies played an important role, but 
private sector innovation, risk-taking capital markets and high global energy prices also 
helped to drive growth.   
Announced and recently enacted policy measures affecting trade, regulation, funding 
and financing, are set to reshape US energy production, demand, end-uses and exports. 
The changes are designed to stimulate domestic production across a range of energy 
sources, focusing on oil, natural gas and coal as well as nuclear, geothermal, hydrogen 
and biofuels. The changes to energy-related tax credits and grants in the OBBBA (selected
