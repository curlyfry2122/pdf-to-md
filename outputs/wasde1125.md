NOTE: Due to lapse in government funding from October 1 through November 12, some U.S. data sources that 
are typically used were not available for the November 2025 WASDE. Changes to the U.S. balance sheets 
continue to reflect all U.S. government data available at the time of publication, but this month, in some cases, 
that information was limited. 
 
WHEAT: The outlook for 2025/26 U.S. wheat this month is for larger supplies and higher ending 
stocks, with no change to use. Supplies are raised on greater production, up 58 million bushels to 
1,985 million, on a record all wheat yield based on the September 30 Small Grains Summary. The 
season-average farm price is lowered $0.10 per bushel to $5.00 as larger global supplies reduce 
price expectations for the remainder of the marketing year.  
The global wheat outlook for 2025/26 is for larger supplies, consumption, trade, and ending stocks. 
Supplies are projected to increase 11.7 million tons to 1,090.3 million on higher production for most of 
the major wheat exporters including Kazakhstan, Argentina, the EU, the United States, Australia, 
Russia, and Canada. Global consumption is increased 4.3 million tons to 818.9 million, primarily on 
higher feed and residual use for Russia, Kazakhstan, and the EU. World trade is 2.5 million tons 
larger at 217.2 million, primarily on greater exports for Argentina, Australia, and Kazakhstan that are 
only partly offset by a reduction for Russia. Projected 2025/26 global ending stocks are raised 7.4 
million tons to 271.4 million, resulting in what would be the first year-to-year increase in global wheat 
stocks since 2019/20. 
COARSE GRAINS: This month’s 2025/26 U.S. corn outlook is for increases in supply, exports, and 
ending stocks. Total supply is 144 million bushels higher as larger beginning stocks are partially 
offset by lower production. Beginning stocks are 207 million bushels higher based on the September 
30 Grain Stocks report. Corn production is forecast at 16.8 billion bushels, down 62 million from 
September on a 0.7-bushel reduction in yield to 186.0 bushels per acre. Harvested area for grain is 
unchanged at 90.0 million acres. Total use is up 100 million bushels reflecting a higher export 
forecast. Exports are raised 100 million bushels to 3.1 billion reflecting shipments to date. Inspection 
data imply exports set a monthly record during September and again in October. With supply rising 
more than use, corn ending stocks are up 44 million bushels to 2.2 billion. The season-average corn 
price received by producers is raised 10 cents to $4.00 per bushel.  
Global coarse grain production for 2025/26 is forecast 3.2 million tons higher to 1.576 billion tons. 
This month’s 2025/26 foreign coarse grain outlook is for larger production, virtually unchanged trade, 
and smaller ending stocks. Foreign corn production is forecast higher reflecting increases for Mexico 
and the EU that are partly offset by a decline for Egypt. Mexico production is raised reflecting greater 
area expectations. The EU is higher as an increase for France is partially offset by a reduction for 
Germany. Foreign barley production is raised reflecting increases for the EU, Russia, Argentina, and 
Ukraine that are partly offset by a cut for the United Kingdom.  
Major global trade changes include greater corn exports for the United States and South Africa but a 
reduction for Ukraine. Corn imports are raised for Iran, Egypt, Venezuela, and the United Kingdom, 
but lowered for China, the EU, and Thailand. Foreign corn ending stocks are reduced, mostly 
reflecting a decline for China that is partly offset by increases for Argentina, Mexico, and Ukraine. 
Global corn ending stocks are down fractionally to 281.3 million tons.

RICE: The outlook for 2025/26 U.S. rice this month is for lower supplies, unchanged domestic use and 
exports, and decreased ending stocks. Supplies are reduced on the NASS November Crop Production 
report, which lowered 2025/26 production by 1.5 million cwt to 207.3 million, all on a smaller yield. The 
average all rice yield is forecast at 7,506 pounds per acre, down 53 pounds from the previous forecast. 
Long-grain production is forecast at 152.7 million cwt and combined medium- and short-grain 
production is at 54.7 million. Projected 2025/26 all rice ending stocks are lowered by 1.5 million cwt to 
51.9 million, down 4 percent from last year. The 2025/26 all rice season-average farm price (SAFP) 
decreased $0.50 per cwt to $12.70 cwt on reduced SAFP forecasts for long-grain and Other States 
(Southern) medium- and short-grain.  
The 2025/26 global rice outlook this month is for slightly lower supplies, fractionally higher 
consumption, increased trade, and lower ending stocks. Supplies are reduced 0.4 million tons to 729.1 
million, mainly on lower beginning stocks for Thailand and Senegal and reduced production for 
Pakistan and Senegal more than offsetting increases for the Philippines and Egypt. World 2025/26 
consumption is raised 0.2 million tons to a record 542.4 million on increases for Nigeria and Egypt. 
Global 2025/26 trade is up 0.8 million tons to 62.9 million, primarily on China and Thailand. Projected 
2025/26 world ending stocks are reduced 0.5 million tons to 186.7 million, mostly on Thailand, 
Pakistan, and Senegal more than offsetting higher stocks for several countries.  
OILSEEDS: U.S. oilseed production for 2025/26 is projected to reach 125.8 million tons, a decrease of 
1.0 million from the previous estimate. The reduction is attributed to lower soybean production, 
although it is partially offset by higher peanut and cottonseed output. Soybean production is forecast at 
4.3 billion bushels, down 48 million, on lower yields. The soybean yield is projected down 0.5 bushels to 
53.0 bushels per acre. Soybean supplies are projected to be 61 million bushels lower than the 
September forecast, due to lower beginning stocks from the September 30 Grain Stocks report and 
reduced production.  
U.S. soybean exports are forecast at 1.64 billion bushels, down 50 million from the previous forecast 
due to lower supplies and higher exports by Brazil and Argentina. In September, Argentina temporarily 
reduced export taxes leading to an influx of export registrations during the peak U.S. export season. 
Further, since the last report, the U.S. entered a trade deal with China, which led to higher U.S. prices 
and narrowed the price spread between U.S. and other major exporters. While U.S. soybean exports 
are expected to rise to China for the rest of the marketing year, these higher shipments could be offset 
by reductions to other markets where the United States no longer holds a large price discount 
compared to other exporters. 
U.S. soybean crush is unchanged and ending stocks are forecast down marginally. The U.S. season-
average soybean price for 2025/26 is raised $0.50 to $10.50 per bushel. The soybean meal price is 
raised $20 to $300 per short ton. The soybean oil price is unchanged at 53 cents per pound. 
Global oilseed production for 2025/26 is lowered this month mainly on lower soybean and sunflower 
production partly offset by higher rapeseed and cottonseed. Soybean production is reduced 4.1 million 
tons on lower output for the United States, Ukraine, and India. Sunflowerseed production is lowered 1.0 
million tons on lower production for Ukraine, Russia, the EU, and Turkey; partly offsetting is higher 
sunflowerseed production for Argentina. Global rapeseed production is raised 1.3 million tons on higher 
production for the EU, Australia, Ukraine, and the UK. 
The global 2025/26 soybean supply and demand forecast includes lower beginning stocks and 
production, reduced crush, slightly higher exports, and lower ending stocks. Beginning stocks are 
lowered 0.2 million tons due to updates to 2024/25 balance sheets. Ending stocks for 2024/25 are 
lowered for the United States, the EU, and Argentina but higher for Brazil and China. EU ending stocks 
are lowered due to higher crush. Argentina’s 2024/25 balance sheet shows higher exports and crush 
leading to lower stocks. Brazil’s 2024/25 balance sheet includes higher production, increased 2.5 
million tons to 171.5 million, reflecting estimates by CONAB and utilization data to date. As a result of

reported data to date, Brazil’s 2024/25 crush, exports, and ending stocks are raised. China’s 2024/25 
ending stocks are increased due to higher imports that are partly offset by higher crush.  
Global soybean crush for 2025/26 is reduced 1.7 million tons to 365.0 million. Crush is reduced for 
India on the lower crop. Crush is reduced for Argentina on lower supplies due to lower beginning stocks 
and higher exports. Partly offsetting is a 1-million-ton increase to Brazilian crush to 59 million tons, 
raised in line with the higher crush estimate for the previous marketing year.  
Global soybean exports for 2025/26 are increased 0.2 million tons to 188.0 million. Exports are raised 
0.5 million tons for Brazil and 2.3 million for Argentina, in line with increases in the previous marketing 
year and large export registrations to date; mostly offsetting are lower shipments for the United States 
and Ukraine. Global ending stocks are reduced 2.0 million tons to 122.0 million, with lower stocks for 
Argentina, Brazil, the United States, the EU, Ukraine, and India partly offset by higher stocks for China. 
SUGAR: U.S. sugar supply and use for 2023/24 and 2024/25 are updated with final year data from 
Sweetener Market Data (SMD). For 2023/24 refiners in the SMD increased raw imports from 2.833 
million short tons, raw value (STRV) to 2.922 million with raw sugar imports that had been formerly 
reported as entering in October 2024/25. Because total sugar imports were not affected, the net 
effect was to residually lower 2023/24 Direct Consumption Imports (DCI) from 777,196 STRV to 
688,365. Resulting deliveries for 2023/24 human consumption came in at 12.336 million. For October 
2024, refiners’ raw imports are lowered 88,406 STRV to 201,969. The net residual effect on DCI in 
October 2024 was to increase it to 50,986 STRV, up from -39,494 reported in previous versions of 
SMD.  
Final sugar production for 2024/25 was 9.396 million STRV. Beet sugar production was 5.370 million 
with a strong 705,874 produced in August and September. Cane sugar production was 4.027 million 
with 114,155 produced in Louisiana in September. Deliveries for human consumption grew to 12.549 
million STRV, buoyed by 2024/25 DCI at a high 964,567 STRV. DCI in July was at a record for that 
month at 263,370 STRV as importers sought to avoid tariffs slated to start in August. Lower 
combined DCI for August and September was insufficient to provide much of an offset to the July 
total. Exports totaled 110,781 with a strong level of beet sugar exports at 83,665, most of which went 
to Mexico. Ending stocks were at 2.489 million for an ending stocks-to-use ratio of 19.84 percent. 
U.S. sugar supply for 2025/26 is projected at 14.121 million STRV, a decrease of 20,364 from 
September as a reduction in production more than offsets increases in beginning stocks and imports. 
Sugar production is projected at 9.319 million. Based on processor reporting in SMD, cane sugar in 
Louisiana is 2.056 million (down 60,736 from September) and Florida is 2,053 STRV (up 1,782). 
Based on NASS forecasts of sugarbeet production, beet sugar is projected at 5.211 million, assuming 
shrink and recovery at 10-year averages. This is down 91,510 STRV from September. Imports are 
increased 78,772 STRV to 2.313 million. High Tier/Other is up 102,818 STRV to 524,731. High Tier 
raw sugar that entered so far this 2025/26 year is at 73,145 STRV and the sugar equivalent of 
molasses imported for refining is projected at 84,318 STRV. High Tier refined projected is unchanged 
at 367,269 STRV. FTA TRQ imports are reduced by 24,046 STRV. 
Sugar use is increased 110,858 STRV to 12.276 million. Deliveries for human consumption are 
projected at 12.071 million STRV, up 110,858 over the September projection but down 478,174 
STRV from 2024/25. Deliveries from domestic processors and refiners are projected at 11.550 million 
STRV as the increased pace of June – September deliveries is carried forward over 2025/26. DCI is 
projected at 521,179 STRV applying the expected share of non-SMD entities for each of the sugar 
import types. Exports are projected at 100,000 STRV as beet processors are projected to ship more 
product to Mexico. Ending stocks are projected at 1.845 million STRV for an ending stock-to-use ratio 
of 15.03 percent. 
Mexico sugar production is projected at 5.019 million metric tons (MT), a decrease of 75,132 from 
September. Rain and flooding in the states of Puebla, Veracruz, and San Luis Potosi are expected to

delay the start of harvest and reduce yields. Deliveries are projected to decrease 54,961 MT in 
September to 4.514 million as human deliveries are down 18,190 MT and IMMEX is down 36,771. 
The Mexico government has raised tariffs to control imports, but these tariffs are not expected to be 
applied to imports from the United States. Ending stocks are at 1.077 million MT to cover use in the 
next marketing year before the start of that year’s campaign and also have a reserve of 150,000 of 
low polarity sugar to ship to the United States in the fourth quarter of 2026. 
LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY: The forecast for 2025 red meat and poultry production is 
lowered from the previous September report with lower beef, pork, and turkey production forecasts 
partially offset by higher broiler production. Beef production is lowered, as reduced steer and heifer 
slaughter and lower weights are partially offset by higher expected cow and bull slaughter. The pork 
production forecast is lowered on a slower pace of slaughter through early November more than 
offsetting higher dressed weights. Slaughter forecasts also reflect updated 2025 hog inventories and 
pig crops provided in the September 25 Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report. Broiler production forecasts 
for the third and fourth quarters are raised based on production data reported through August and 
daily slaughter data reported through early November. Turkey production is lowered on production 
data reported through August and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)-related culling through 
early November. Egg production is lowered based on production data reported through August and 
HPAI cases reported through early November. 
For 2026, beef production is lowered on reduced steer and heifer slaughter, with the slower rate of 
fed cattle marketings expected to carry into the first half of 2026. Pork production is reduced on lower 
expected hog supplies for the year, with reduced farrowing expectations for late-2025 and early-2026 
indicated in the Quarterly Hogs and Pigs report. Broiler production is raised as the recent increased 
in slaughter rates is expected to carry into 2026. Turkey production is reduced for the first and 
second quarters based on recent HPAI-related culling. Egg production is unchanged from the 
previous report. 
The beef import forecasts for 2025 and 2026 are unchanged from the previous report based on U.S. 
Census data reported through July. Beef exports are reduced in the third quarter of 2025 but remain 
unchanged for the outlying quarters of 2025 and 2026. Pork exports are unchanged for 2025 but are 
reduced for 2026 on tighter domestic supplies. Broiler exports are raised for 2025 on recent data, 
with higher exports carrying into 2026. Turkey exports are reduced for 2025 and 2026 on the most 
recent data and tighter domestic supplies. 
Livestock and poultry prices for 2025 are updated to reflect reported monthly data through the third 
quarter. Cattle prices are reduced for the fourth quarter of 2025 based on recent prices, with reduced 
prices carrying into 2026. The fourth quarter hog price forecast is lowered on reported daily prices 
through early November, but the 2026 price forecast is raised on tighter expected hog supplies. The 
fourth quarter broiler price forecast is lowered on recent prices and raised production expectations, 
with reductions continuing into 2026. Turkey prices are raised for the fourth quarter of 2025 on recent 
price levels, with reduced production expected to support higher prices in 2026. Egg prices are 
reduced on lower third quarter prices continuing into the beginning of the fourth quarter. The 2026 
egg price forecast is also reduced. 
The milk production forecast for 2025 is raised from the previous report. Higher milk cow inventories 
and robust milk per cow through the third quarter of 2025 were reported in the recent Milk Production 
report. The milk production forecast for 2026 is also raised, as the higher inventories and increased 
productivity rates are expected to carry into next year. 
The import forecast for 2025 is lowered on a fat basis, primarily on fewer shipments of butter. Imports 
on a skim-solids basis for 2025 are unchanged. Exports for 2025 are raised on both a fat basis, 
primarily on competitive butter and cheese prices, and on a skim-solids basis due to more shipments 
of whey-containing products. Fat basis exports are also raised for 2026 on higher shipments of butter 
and cheese, while skim-solids basis exports are unchanged.

The butter price forecast for 2025 is reduced as increased supplies of milkfat have resulted in sharply 
lower prices for the third and fourth quarters of 2025. Cheese and nonfat dry milk (NDM) prices are 
also lowered for 2025 as increased milk supplies put downward pressure on dairy product prices. The 
whey price forecast is raised on strong demand. Class III prices are reduced, as lower cheese prices 
more than offset higher whey prices. Class IV prices are reduced on lower butter and NDM prices. 
The all milk price forecast for 2025 is lowered to $21.05 per cwt. 
For 2026, butter, cheese, and NDM prices are lowered on increased milk supplies. The whey price 
forecast is raised, as strong demand is expected to continue into 2026. The Class III price is raised 
with higher whey prices more than offsetting the declines in cheese prices. The Class IV price is 
reduced on lower butter and NDM prices. The all milk price is projected lower at $19.25 per cwt. 
COTTON: The November outlook for 2025/26 U.S. cotton supply and demand shows higher 
production, exports and ending stocks compared to September, with no change to consumption and 
imports. The forecast for U.S. production is raised almost 900,000 bales to 14.1 million, reflecting 
higher expected yields in most States and increasing the projected national average yield almost 7 
percent to 919 pounds per harvested acre. The export forecast is increased 200,000 bales to 12.2 
million. The balance of the production increase flows to ending stocks, which are raised almost 20 
percent to 4.3 million bales, for a stocks-to-use ratio of 30.9 percent. The projected season-average 
upland price for 2025/26 is lowered to 62 cents per pound. 
The 2025/26 outlook for world cotton supply and demand in November shows higher production, 
consumption, trade, and stocks compared to the September outlook. Global cotton production is 
forecast 2.4 million bales higher with increases of 1 million bales in China, about 900,000 bales in the 
United States, and 500,000 bales in Brazil. World trade is raised 300,000 bales and consumption 
50,000 bales. Beginning stocks are raised over 400,000 bales largely reflecting updated 2024/25 
trade data for several countries. As a result of these changes, global ending stocks are raised about 
2.8 million bales to 75.9 million.
